 abstract = {Sedimentary minerals, especially secondary clay minerals, are the significant factor for the grain composition and microstructure of fine-grained soils, which further affect dynamic characteristics. Much research has focused on the mineral content’s influence on sand liquefaction research in which soil samples consisted of sand particles with a size larger than 0.074mm and of fine-grained minerals with a size less than 0.074 mm (e.g., kaolinite, illite, montmorillonite, etc.). However, few tests have been conducted for the dynamic characteristics of fine-grained soil, especially for high plasticity clay (CH), which is often composed of fine particles and even colloidal particles (less than 0.002 mm), including primary soil minerals and secondary clay minerals. According to the results of X-ray diffraction tests on the mineral composition of marine clay in the Pearl River Delta and Han River Delta in Guang-dong Province, resonant column tests were performed with mixture samples of four mineral components in which quartz and albite act as matrix and Na-montmorillonite and kaolinite act as variable quantity, with particle size less than 0.074mm, and are reported in this paper. The growth of Na-montmorillonite content is demonstrated as increasing the maximum dynamic shear modulus. Combined with sample performance under an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM), the fact that maximum dynamic shear modulus is determined by the initial state of particle compositions is clarified. Given the same void ratio and stress history condition, the sample with higher Na-montmorillonite content, due to the property of Na-montmorillonite minerals, forms a flocculation structure with more intergranular contact and is conductive to shear-wave propagation. The results further show that plasticity is influenced by mineral compositions as an internal reason and reflects the maximum dynamic shear modulus. © 2019 Associazione Geotecnica Italiana, Rome, Italy.},
