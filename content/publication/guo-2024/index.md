abstract: Owing to its high flexibility and low permeability characteristics, clayey
  soil has been largely used as impermeable material in pollutant burial fillers.
  Soil permeability is very sensitive and highly pertains to its microstructure. When
  subjected to the saline environment changes, the changes in soil permeability may
  increase leakage risk in the burial fillers and endanger the environment. Herein,
  to facilitate the understanding of the negative correlation between the permeability
  and ion concentrations in some low plastic limit clays, NaCl solution seepage circulation
  experiments considering different porosities, sample preparation methods, and ion
  concentration stages were conducted. Combined with the micro test methods (SEM and
  MIP) and the fractal theory, the changes in soil permeability at different ion concentrations
  and the mechanism were studied. The main results showed that compression methods
  are more suitable than the impact-involved methods for making uniform soil samples;
  the decrease of the soil’s pore fractal dimension evidenced that the growth of ion
  concentration would increase the dispersal of soil particles while the morphological
  change of the dispersal process resembles the blossom of a flower, i.e., the sprout→bud
  phase→blossom; the dispersed particles are prone to form flocculation in large-size
  pores (6–8 μm in this paper) and decrease the soil permeability. This dispersal
  and flocculation effect progressively triggered by the growth of ion concentration
  can provide new insight into understanding the negative correlation between the
  permeability and ion concentrations in some low plastic limit clays. © The Author(s)
