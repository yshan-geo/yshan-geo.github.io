abstract: Soil liquefaction is relevant to the development of excess pore water pressure
  and strain, as well as the energy dissipation in the soils. A series of cyclic triaxial
  undrained tests are conducted on a typical low-plasticity fine-grained soil (Taiping
  tailings) to evaluate cyclic response at different cyclic stress levels. There are
  four testing samples subjected to different cyclic stress ratios on the condition
  of the same void ratio. A unified viscous energy dissipation ratio (VEDR), which
  is a normalized energy ratio based on the relationship between cyclic stress and
  strain, is proposed to study the energy dissipation at each cycle. In general, growth
  trends of cyclic strain amplitude (ϵcyc), excess pore water pressure ratio (ru),
  and VEDR for testing samples depend on the applied cyclic stress levels. And the
  variations of VEDR versus ϵcyc and ru indicate VEDR is not only related to strain
  and excess pore water pressure development levels but also can reflect the triggering
  of excess pore water pressure and threshold strain (close to 0.02%). Additionally,
  the VEDR results can provide a meaningful basis to study the specific particle behaviors
  in the process of cyclic loading. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.
