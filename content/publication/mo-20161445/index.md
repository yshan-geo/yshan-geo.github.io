abstract: In order to quantitatively analyze the dynamic shear modulus from the perspective
  of micro soil structure, relationships between the dynamic shear modulus and the
  intergranular void of remolded soft clay from Eastern Guangdong are studied from
  both macroscopic and microcosmic aspects using the resonant column test, the scanning
  electron microscope test and the microscopic-pore structure analysis method. According
  to the three-parameter Davidenkov model-based nonlinear regression analysis and
  the parameters analysis of microscopic-pore structure, the effective stress was
  found to increase and the wave velocity to accelerate after the consolidation process
  and thus maximum dynamic shear modulus became larger. The macro void ratio of soil
  decreased. The intergranular void layers grew and the fractal dimension of porous
  perimeter-area increased. The degree of void homogenization increased and the porous
  fractal dimension value decreased. The study demonstrates the correlation between
  the three parameters of Davidenkov model(initial parameter, range parameter and
  rate parameter) and the microscopic-pore structure parameters. Â© 2016, Science Press.
