abstract: An eco-friendly way to improve the engineering properties of lower-strength
  soils becomes attractive. This study investigates the feasibility of two industrial
  by-products, i.e., coal gangue (CG) and calcium carbide residue (CCR), as a sustainable
  CG–CCR geopolymer binder for soil stabilization. The geomechanical properties, compressibility,
  and microstructure of marine clay stabilized using CG–CCR geopolymer with different
  content by mass from 0 to 30% are measured by conducting consolidated undrained
  (CU) triaxial compression tests, oedometer tests, X-ray diffraction, mercury intrusion
  porosimetry, and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. A new empirical model
  is proposed to predict the failure strength of stabilized soils. Results indicate
  that the CG–CCR geopolymer can enhance the geomechanical properties of marine clay.
  Increasing the geopolymer content to 15% transforms the behavior of stabilized soils
  from a strain-hardening response (ductile failure) into a strain-softening response
  (brittle failure). The failure strength increases with the geopolymer content, confining
  pressure, and curing time. Increasing the geopolymer content to 30% improves the
  cohesion and internal friction angle to 479.8 kPa and 21.1°, respectively, being
  approximately 96.1 and 4.9 times those of unstabilized soil. The geopolymer content
  of 30% is found as the optimum to achieve the lowest compressibility. Microstructural
  analyses show that the reaction products of CG–CCR geopolymer binder could fill
  the intergranular pores and densify the soil by reducing the void space between
  soil particles, explaining the strength improvement of marine clay. This study provides
  a potential strategy for enhancing the geomechanical properties of marine clay by
  utilizing industrial geological waste. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence
