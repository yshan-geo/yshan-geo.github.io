abstract: The Rayleigh wave propagation in the irregular bottom of the ocean, which
  is the interface of a homogeneous non-viscous liquid layer overlaying a porous half-space,
  under the influence of different factors has been discussed. The mathematical model
  is established by formula derivation. The propagation and attenuation characteristics
  of Rayleigh waves in a liquid layer over a transverse isotropy liquid-saturated
  porous half-space with irregular interface were studied. In addition, the dispersion
  and attenuation equations of the phase velocity and the attenuation coefficient
  with respect to the wave number were derived by which the effects of different parameters
  were analyzed. It was found that the magnitude of phase velocity varies with respect
  to the corrugation degree of the interface. In addition, irrespective of the type
  of interface, initially the attenuation coefficient rapidly increases and after
  the maximum value, it becomes constant. Furthermore, it has been observed that the
  change of the permeability coefficient affects the Rayleigh wave attenuation for
  the low wave number. For the low wave number, smaller permeability coefficient results
  in larger phase velocity and smaller attenuation. Moreover, both the phase velocity
  and the attenuation coefficient will eventually approach constant value in the high
  wave number region, for all parameters. Â© 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor
