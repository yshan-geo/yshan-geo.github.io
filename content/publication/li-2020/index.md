abstract: Adding rubber into sands has been found to improve the mechanical behavior
  of sands, including their dynamic properties. However, ambiguous and even contradictory
  results have been reported regarding the dynamic behavior of sand-rubber mixtures,
  particularly in terms of the damping ratio. A series of cyclic triaxial tests were,
  therefore, performed under a large range of shear strains on sand-rubber mixtures
  with varying rubber volume contents, rubber particle sizes, and confining pressures.
  The results indicate the dynamic shear modulus decreases with increasing rubber
  volume content and with decreasing particle size and confining pressure. The relationship
  of the damping ratio to the evaluated parameters is complicated and strain-dependent;
  at shear strains less than a critical value, the damping ratio increases with increasing
  rubber volume content, whereas the opposite trend is observed at greater shear strains.
  Furthermore, sand-rubber mixtures with different rubber particle sizes exceed the
  damping ratio of pure sand at different rubber volume contents. A new empirical
  model to predict the maximum shear moduli of mixtures with various rubber volume
  contents, rubber particle sizes, and confining pressures is accordingly proposed.
  This study provides a reference for the design of sand-rubber mixtures in engineering
  applications. Â© 2020 by the authors.
