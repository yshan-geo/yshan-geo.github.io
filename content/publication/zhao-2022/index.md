abstract: Steel frame structures often use exposed column-base plate connections.
  Studies on such connections have mainly focused on the mechanical properties along
  the strong axis. Thus, the seismic performance evaluation for the weak axis direction,
  which may cause insufficient structural safety, has been underestimated. The present
  study discusses the results of eight cyclic loading tests along the minor axis of
  exposed column-base plate connections. Then, the effects of the axial compression
  ratio, the size of the column section, the diameter and the arrangement of anchor
  bolts, the thickness of the base plate, and any stiffeners on the connection's seismic
  performance are quantified. It was found that the failure mode is breaking of the
  anchor bolts except for two specimens with torn welding lines. Also, all hysteretic
  curves are the slip type with the highest ductility coefficient of 10.49. The experimental
  results are used to build a numerical model based on the finite element method.
  Also, the stiffness calculation formula for the weak axis direction is derived using
  the component method. In addition, a technique for predicting a column's moment-rotation
  curve is proposed. It will be shown that the results of this technique agree well
  with those of the finite element model and with the experimental data. Â© 2022 Elsevier
