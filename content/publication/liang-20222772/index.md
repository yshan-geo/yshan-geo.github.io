abstract: The aim of this paper is to study the asymmetric collapse mechanism of the
  overlying rock mass of shallow tunnel under seismic load. Based on the Hoek-Brown
  failure criterion, combined with the upper bound theorem of the limit analysis and
  the variational method of the variable endpoints problem, the analytical solution
  of the asymmetric collapse curve is proposed. The effects of seismic body wave and
  rock parameters on the asymmetric collapse curve are analyzed. It can be found that,
  without considering the damage of rock mass, the S-wave will tilt the geometric
  shape of collapsing block, which is beneficial to restrain the collapse. And the
  restrain effect is more significant in the rock mass with better mechanical properties.
  The backward propagation of P-wave will promote the collapse of the rock block and
  make the geometrical area of the collapsing block smaller. This implies that under
  seismic load, a smaller range of allowable velocity field can lead to the ultimate
  failure state of rock mass. The conclusion of this paper will help to provide a
  safer design and construction guidance for engineering practice. © 2022, Science
