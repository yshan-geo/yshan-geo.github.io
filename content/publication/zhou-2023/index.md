abstract: The backfill soil is the first line of defense that ensures immersed tunnel's
  safety and stability, but its seismic performance has not been investigated in previous
  studies. This study employs the Ruyifang tunnel as its research object to determine
  the most dangerous cross-section. It establishes a two-dimensional soil-structure
  interaction system for complex sites to evaluate immersed tunnels' safety during
  earthquakes, clarify the structural failure mechanism, and optimize the backfilling
  scheme. In addition, this study investigates the tunnel element's response, damage,
  and stress under static and dynamic loads and obtains the impact of backfilling
  materials by considering plastic damage in structures, soil viscoelastic properties,
  and various backfilling schemes. The results showed that the tunnel section's stress
  has prominently distributed characteristics. Moreover, the structure exhibits tensile
  failure during ground motions, and the bottom of the side wall is the critical area.
  The inertial force is the primary factor affecting the seismic capacity at the overburden
  layer and flanks, while stiffness plays a vital role at the cushion. These dynamic
  properties and related backfilling technology can provide technical support for
  the anti-seismic design of immersed tunnels. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd
