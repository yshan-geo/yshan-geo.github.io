abstract: "Calcareous gravelly sand (CGS) is the primary building material used in
  the foundation filling of island-reefs in the South China Sea. In this study, multiple
  consolidation-drained triaxial shear tests were conducted on CGS, in order to reveal
  the effects of relative density (Dr) and effective confining pressure (σ3′) on the
  CGS dilatancy. The applicability of classical dilatancy equations to CGS was tested.
  An empirical dilatancy equation applicable to calcareous sand was proposed and the
  rationality of this dilatancy equation was validated. According to the results:
  (I) Phase-transition stress ratio (ηp) and failure dilatancy ratio (df) are important
  indices for assessing the CGS dilatancy. Physical models were built to predict the
  ηp and df of CGS based on its Dr and σ3′, respectively. (II) The dilatancy equation
  of the modified Cam-clay model could not reflect the CGS dilatancy. Rowe's dilatancy
  equation could reflect the CGS dilatancy to some extent, but it underestimated the
  CGS dilatancy when σ3' ≤ 50 kPa and overestimated the CGS dilatancy when σ3' ≥ 400
  kPa. (III) A good linear relationship was identified between dilatancy ratio and
  stress ratio-related parameter (ηf2-η2η0.5). Therefore, the empirical dilatancy
  equation built on this basis is highly applicable to calcareous sand. © 2022 Elsevier
