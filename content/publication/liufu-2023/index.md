abstract: Calcareous sand is a type of biological sand deposited from the remains
  of marine organisms. Although widely used in coastal construction, the reinforcement
  of calcareous sand is necessary due to its natures of low bearing capacity and high
  compressibility. Aiming for this, an environmentally bio-grouting technique, microbially
  induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) was applied to reinforce the calcareous
  sand. However, MICP treatment is in turn influenced by the properties of calcareous
  sand, such as particle size and gradation. To reveal the effects of particle size
  and gradation, the MICP-treated calcareous sands with various median sizes, uniformity
  coefficients or curvature coefficients, were conducted with the unconfined compressive
  strength (UCS) tests and a series of laboratory experiments. The results indicated
  that with the median size or uniformity coefficient increasing, the UCS of the MICP-treated
  specimens decreased; while with increasing curvature coefficient, the UCS exhibited
  a trend of increasing before decreasing. Further experiments reveal that particle
  size and gradation affect the MICP process mainly by changing the amounts and volume
  of pores. The current study demonstrates the respective effects of particle size
  and gradation on the treatment of MICP and provides a theoretical reference for
  reinforcing calcareous sand in marine engineering. Â© 2023 Elsevier Ltd
