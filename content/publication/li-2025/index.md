abstract: Different gas hydrate types, such as methane hydrate and carbon dioxide
  hydrate, exhibit distinct geomechanical responses and hydrate morphologies in gas-hydrate-bearing
  sediments (GHBSs). However, most constitutive models for GHBSs focus on methane-hydrate-bearing
  sediments (MHBSs), while largely overlooking carbon-dioxide-hydrate-bearing sediments
  (CHBSs). This paper proposes a modified Mohr–Coulomb (M-C) model for GHBSs that
  incorporates the geomechanical effects of both MHBSs and CHBSs. The model integrates
  diverse hydrate morphologies—cementing, load-bearing, and pore-filling—into hydrate
  saturation and incorporates an effective confining pressure. Its validity was demonstrated
  through simulations of reported triaxial compression tests for both MHBSs and CHBSs.
  Moreover, a variance-based sensitivity analysis using Sobol’s method evaluated the
  effects of hydrate-related soil properties on the geomechanical behavior of GHBSs.
  The results indicate that the shear modulus influences the yield axial strain of
  the CHBSs and could be up to 1.15 times more than that of the MHBSs. Similarly,
  the bulk modulus showed an approximate 5% increase in its impact on the yield volumetric
  strain of the CHBSs compared with the MHBSs. These findings provide a unified framework
  for modeling GHBSs and have implications for CO2-injection-induced methane production
  from deep sediments, advancing the understanding and simulation of GHBS geomechanical
  behavior. © 2025 by the authors.
