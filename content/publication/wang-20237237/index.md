abstract: Understanding the diffusion law of cement slurry is the key to analyzing
  and evaluating the reinforcement effect of grouting. This study aimed to reveal
  the flow grouting mechanism of slurry in the reserved space between piles and soil
  and the penetration diffusion rule of slurry in the soil around the piles. For this
  purpose, the grouting slurry was regarded as a Newtonian fluid. The Navier–Stokes
  equations of fluid mechanics and renormalization group k–ε model were used to study
  the flow diffusion of slurry in the reserved space around a pile for grouting the
  drilling with prestressed concrete pipes. The permeability of soil slurry was determined
  using Darcy's law, and the flow field of slurry during grouting was numerically
  simulated. The results showed that the flow velocity of slurry and the reinforcement
  effect of grouting decrease gradually as the flow path extends. The radial flow
  of slurry in the grouting pipe shows a clear trend of circumferential diffusion.
  The slurry thickness in the reserved space for grouting decreases with an increase
  in the distance from the grouting outlet. Its attenuation trend becomes more obvious
  with increasing grouting height. The grouting thickness directly reflects the filling
  effect of slurry and is an important index to evaluate the grouting effect of drilling
  with prestressed concrete pipes. © 2023 International Federation for Structural
