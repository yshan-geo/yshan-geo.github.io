abstract: 'The strength of marine clay under cyclic loading is affected by its mineral
  composition, which must be considered in engineering design. Consolidated undrained
  cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on specimens from two groups of samples of
  artificial marine clays consisting of four pure minerals (quartz, albite, Na-montmorillonite
  and kaolinite) in mass proportion (Qc:Ac:Mc:Kc). The study of two test groups was
  to identify differences in the properties of the soils due to montmorillonite and
  kaolinite (MKDT group) and the differences due to the nonclay minerals (NCDT group).
  The results demonstrated the following main points. The power function curves for
  cyclic strength derived from conventional strain failure criteria show that both
  montmorillonite and clay minerals significantly increase cyclic strength. Furthermore,
  the energy based viscous energy dissipation ratio (VEDR) was introduced to partition
  cyclic loading process into two stages: competition and rapid increasing. There
  were two critical points in the cyclic loading procedure, VEDRmin and VEDRbreakpoint,
  that represent initial energy dissipation and turning-point energy dissipation.
  Therefore, by connecting the VEDRbreakpoint points, the linear VEDR cyclic strength
  curve (NVEDR-VEDRbreakpoint) was created with two parameters, slopVEDR and VEDRintercept.
  By analogy with the parameters of conventional cyclic strength curve (a, b and CSRmin),
  slopVEDR and VEDRintercept respectively reflect that influence of cyclic loading
  and mineral composition on VEDRbreakpoint. Additionally, it is also demonstrated
  that both montmorillonite and clay minerals reinforce VEDR cyclic strength just
  like the conventional one. This research makes a major contribution to our understanding
  of cyclic strength by accounting for energy dissipation. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.'
