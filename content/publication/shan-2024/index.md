abstract: Due to cyclic loading, clays composed of different mineral compositions
  exhibit non-linear viscoelastic characteristics. This study quantified the effect
  of the mineral composition on the non-linear viscoelastic properties of clays. Large-amplitude
  oscillatory shear rheological tests and cryo-electron microscopy tests were conducted
  on clays containing quartz, feldspar, montmorillonite, and kaolinite (Q, F, Mt.,
  and Kaol). The results indicated that as the clay content in the soil sample increased,
  so did the value of relative intensity(I3/1), the Lissajous curves shifted from
  elliptical to rectangular, and the absolute values of the overall non-linear viscoelasticity
  parameters (NEand NV) were also larger. In addition, its non-linear viscoelasticity
  was more prominent, supported by the cryo-electron microscopy test outcomes. Montmorillonite
  played a more significant role than kaolinite in increasing the nonlinear viscoelasticity
  of the soil samples. The study findings have significant academic and practical
  value, facilitating an in-depth understanding of the viscoelastic behavior of clays,
  rheological studies of other types of clay soils, and geotechnical engineering applications.
