abstract: The backfilling of foundation groove of immersed tunnels is an important
  procedure in the construction, but the influence mechanism of its seismic performance
  is seldomly mentioned in the previous researches. In order to investigate the influences
  of the stiffness of backfill materials on the deformation of flexible joints in
  the immersed tunnels, the numerical tests of longitudinal dynamic response analysis
  under incidence of P waves are carried out for Ruyifang immersed tunnel in Guangzhou
  by using the particle-spring-beam model with implementation of the longitudinal
  displacement method and the flexible joint model with the longitudinal limit devices.
  The results show that the numerical model and method can make the structures respond
  in a timely and reasonable manner. When the longitudinal response displacement method
  is used for calculation and analysis, the time histories of multi-point displacement
  in the free field should be extracted as the excitation of the structures. The untreated
  soft silt clay cannot be used as the backfill materials. If the density of sand
  or gravel is increased, the seismic capacity will be further improved. The research
  results may provide a more reliable model and design basis for the response analysis
  and seismic design of immersed tunnels under earthquakes. © 2023 Chinese Society
