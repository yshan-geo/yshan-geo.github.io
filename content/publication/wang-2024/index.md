abstract: Studying the effects of weathering on the mechanical properties and microscopic
  evolution of weathered granite soil (WGS) is essential for connecting microstructure
  with macroscopic behavior. This study conducts systematic monotonic and cyclic triaxial
  tests, along with a series of microscopic tests on WGS samples, to explore the influence
  of weathering on WGS mechanical properties and the mechanism of granite weathering.
  Results indicate that both effective internal friction angle and effective cohesion
  decrease progressively with increased weathering. Completely weathered granite (CWG)
  exhibits greater dynamic strength compared to granite residual soil (GRS). Additionally,
  as weathering progresses, quartz fragments are lost, while feldspar and biotite
  weather to form secondary minerals such as kaolinite and illite, leading to an overall
  enrichment in aluminum and iron in the granite. Weathering causes structural deterioration
  of WGS. Finally, the mechanical parameters of WGS and their chemical weathering
  indices show a coefficient of determination ranging from 60 to 99%. This study helps
  elucidate the fundamental causes of performance changes in WGS, thereby optimizing
  engineering design and enhancing disaster prediction accuracy, while providing new
  research perspectives and experimental evidence for WGS. Â© The Author(s) 2024.
