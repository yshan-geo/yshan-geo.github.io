abstract: The selection of appropriate inter-particle parameters in discrete element
  method (DEM) simulations is crucial, and the commonly used trial-and-error method
  has been criticised for its uncontrollability and high computational cost. Therefore,
  this study proposes a new framework based on convolutional neural networks (CNN)
  as an alternative method for calibrating inter-particle parameters in calcareous
  sand materials. Firstly, a biaxial test dataset for calcareous sand was generated
  using DEM simulations. This data set was then used to train a CNN to capture the
  primary underlying correlation between macroscopic mechanical properties and the
  inter-particle parameters of the contact model. To demonstrate the powerful performance
  of CNN, this paper also established a back-propagation neural network (BP) and gated
  recurrent units (GRUs) as control experiments. The results showed that the CNN had
  higher prediction accuracy compared to the BP and GRU models. After DEM simulation
  using the parameters predicted by the CNN, it was found that the stress–strain curves
  and failure patterns closely matched the results of the laboratory tests. This confirms
  that the CNN can quickly and accurately determine the inter-particle parameters
  for DEM simulation and verifies the robustness of the CNN model in predicting laboratory
  test results, this method provides a reference for the calibration of DEM parameters
  for calcareous sand, thereby offering strong support for the use of calcareous sand
  in marine development and construction projects. © The Author(s), under exclusive
