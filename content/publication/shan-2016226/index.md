abstract: In this paper, using the resonant column test, electron microscope observation,
  and microscopic structure analysis, the relationship between the maximum dynamic
  shear modulus and the microscopic particles arrangement of remolded clay soil was
  examined. Focusing on the soil microstructure, this study found that, as the effective
  consolidation stress increases, the soil particles are rearranged in an orientation
  parallel to the direction of maximum principal stress and maximum shear stress.
  The probabilistic entropy of the soil particle arrangement decreases, the mechanical
  wave velocity in the continuous medium of the soil particles increases, and the
  maximum dynamic shear modulus increases. Â© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media
