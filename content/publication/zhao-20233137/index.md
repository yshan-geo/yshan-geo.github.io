abstract: Calcareous sand foundations may be damaged by waves or earthquakes. Therefore,
  such foundations should be reinforced. In this study, a series of bacterial solution
  tests and cyclic triaxial tests were performed to investigate the reinforcing effect
  of microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) treatment of calcareous sand
  in different NaCl concentrations. In bacterial solution tests, the microbial activity
  and microbial mineralization products were examined. At 32 hr, the OD600 and urease
  of MAT35 were lower than MAT0 by 21.94% and 43.53%. In 0–48 hr, the OD600 and activity
  of MAT80 and MAT100 were below 0.15 and 1 mM urea/min. The productivity of calcium
  carbonate after MICP decreased with an increase in NaCl concentration. The cyclic
  triaxial tests showed that with an increase in NaCl concentration, the accumulation
  rate of pore pressure increased, and the number of strain-accumulation cycles decreased.
  Although the stiffness and cyclic resistance of the samples decreased with an increase
  in NaCl concentration, both were higher than those of untreated sands. Scanning
  electron microscopy images showed that as the NaCl concentration increased, the
  calcium carbonate was precipitated gradually changed from a cluster to individual
  crystals; this change in form is the main reason for the decrease in liquefaction
  resistance. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.
