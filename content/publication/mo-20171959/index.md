abstract: 'In order to study the relationship between the accumulative plastic strain
  growth and the energy dissipation, and to further classify the pattern of the accumulative
  plastic strain growth, dynamic consolidated-undrained triaxial shear tests are conducted
  on tailing silts with different void ratios under different cyclic stress ratios.
  The energy dissipation in soil is divided into plastic strain and viscous accumulative
  energy dissipations. According to the relationships, failure modes of the accumulative
  plastic strain growth are reclassified, and the development of accumulative plastic
  strain is interpreted based on the improved energy dissipation mechanism. The research
  highlights that as the cyclic stress ratio keeps increasing, the rate of dissipation
  of viscous accumulative energy will exceed that of the plastic strain accumulative
  energy,and the development mode of accumulative plastic strain will turn from the
  stability to the failure. Furthermore, the failure modes are reasonably divided
  into four categories: stable type, stable damage type, damage type and collapse.
  Essentially, the plastic strain accumulative energy will dissipate due to the rearrangement
  among relatively large particles such as sand and silt grains. Similarly, the viscous
  accumulative energy will dissipate because of the relative slippage among clay particles
  and colloid particles under the relaxation of weak bound water in the double electrical
  layers. This energy dissipation mechanism is consistent with the proposed failure
  pattern of the accumulative plastic strain growth. The research results may provide
  a basis for further model researches on the accumulative plastic strain growth.
