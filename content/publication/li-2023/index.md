abstract: 'The architectural relics of ancient vernacular residences and villages
  with brick–timber structures are at great risk of fire; if one occurs, they cannot
  be recovered. To protect this cultural heritage, this study takes a southern Guangdong
  He Xinwu building complex as a case study. It focuses on four indicator systems:
  human factors, facility factors, environmental factors, and social management factors,
  and 20 sub-indicators to establish an assessment system for fire risk in vernacular
  residences. Combining triangular fuzzy hierarchical analysis and the entropy weight
  method to determine weight values reduces evaluation subjectivity, allowing for
  both qualitative and quantitative measurements to derive the safety level and determine
  key fire risk factors. The results showed that human misconduct and social management
  of fire had the greatest impact on fire risk (29% and 25.8%, respectively). The
  most important secondary indicators were the ability to fight fires early on, the
  fire resistance level of building materials, fire rescue capability, fire load,
  and electricity use by villagers. Moreover, comparing differences in protection
  between ancient houses and high-rise buildings provided targeted policy recommendations
  that offer a new perspective for protecting architectural heritage from fires. ©
