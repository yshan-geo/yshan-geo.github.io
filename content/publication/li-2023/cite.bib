 abstract = {The architectural relics of ancient vernacular residences and villages with brick–timber structures are at great risk of fire; if one occurs, they cannot be recovered. To protect this cultural heritage, this study takes a southern Guangdong He Xinwu building complex as a case study. It focuses on four indicator systems: human factors, facility factors, environmental factors, and social management factors, and 20 sub-indicators to establish an assessment system for fire risk in vernacular residences. Combining triangular fuzzy hierarchical analysis and the entropy weight method to determine weight values reduces evaluation subjectivity, allowing for both qualitative and quantitative measurements to derive the safety level and determine key fire risk factors. The results showed that human misconduct and social management of fire had the greatest impact on fire risk (29% and 25.8%, respectively). The most important secondary indicators were the ability to fight fires early on, the fire resistance level of building materials, fire rescue capability, fire load, and electricity use by villagers. Moreover, comparing differences in protection between ancient houses and high-rise buildings provided targeted policy recommendations that offer a new perspective for protecting architectural heritage from fires. © 2023 by the authors.},
