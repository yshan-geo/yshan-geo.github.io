abstract: 'Many laboratory studies have shown that particle size distribution (PSD)
  affects the liquefaction susceptibility of granular materials. However, few studies
  have focused on the impact of PSD on coral particles. In this study, two different
  soil families were prepared: one with three levels of mean particle size (D50) with
  identical uniformity coefficient (Cu)and the other with four levels of Cu with the
  same D50 for coral gravelly soils. In addition, a series of undrained cyclic triaxial
  tests were conducted on coral gravelly particles with two groups of PSDs at a relative
  density of 40% and an adequate confining pressure of 100 kPa. The test results indicated
  that D50 with identical Cu can affect the undrained cyclic behavior of coral gravelly
  particles. In contrast, Cu with identical D50 does not impact the undrained cyclic
  behavior of coral gravelly particles. The developing pore water pressure was uniform
  when the sample was subjected to the same cyclic loading. For samples with changing
  D50 values of 2.35, 4.70, and 7.05 mm, increasing D50 improved the cyclic liquefaction
  resistance. For samples with changing Cu, increasing Cu in the range of 1.06–5.00
  first increased and then decreased the liquefaction resistance. © 2023 by the authors.'
