abstract: Constructing infrastructure on soft soils demands the implementation of
  ground improvement. This study proposed an eco-friendly method of stabilizing marine
  soil using a calcium carbide residue (CCR)-activated coal gangue (CG) geopolymer
  derived from industrial waste. Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate
  the mechanical properties, durability performance, and stabilization mechanisms
  of stabilized marine soils under multiple wetting-dry cycles. The results highlighted
  the effectiveness of CG-CCR geopolymer by a content of 15% to achieve satisfactory
  strength gain over the engineering requirements. However, the largest decrease in
  strength (71.89%) was observed when the initial water content was beyond 1.5 times
  the liquid limit (LL). The optimum solution was proposed to have a geopolymer content
  of 15% or an initial water content of 1.25·LL to exhibit the highest resistance
  to strength decay after 12 cycles. Compared with water intrusion, mass loss had
  a more significant effect on soil strength deterioration. The formation of noncrystalline
  or amorphous-phase reaction products effectively filled intergranular pores and
  reduced the void space between soil particles, improving the mechanical properties.
  The CG-CCR geopolymer was demonstrated to offer a promising solution for soil improvement
  in geotechnical engineering and waste reduction in industry as a soil stabilizer.
