abstract: This study investigates the use of calcium carbide residue (CCR) as a potential
  alternative to NaOH for activating coal gangue (CG) geopolymers, both of industrial
  waste. A series of experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of CCR content,
  NaOH:Na2SiO3 mass ratios, liquid to solid ratio (L/(CG + CCR)), and curing time
  on the strength development of CG-CCR geopolymers. Moreover, X-ray diffraction (XRD),
  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),
  mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), and field emission scanning electron microscopy
  (FESEM) were used to analyze the reaction products and microstructural characteristics
  of CG-CCR geopolymer. Accordingly, the CG-CCR geopolymers were applied to stabilize
  soft soil. Experimental results indicate that CCR could significantly enhance the
  compressive strength of CG-CCR geopolymer. A CCR content of 20% correlates to the
  greatest increase in 3-d compressive strength (327.6%) compared with pure CG geopolymer
  (CCR = 0%). The optimal NaOH:Na2SiO3 mass ratio is 50:50, while the compressive
  strength increases with decreasing L/(CG + CCR) and increasing curing time. Based
  on the analysis of microstructure (XRD, FTIR, TGA, MIP, and FESEM), it was inferred
  that CCR could promote the polymerization reaction and increase the reaction products
  (primarily N-A-S-H and C-A-S-H gels) of CG-CCR geopolymers, which are responsible
  for the strength development. Additionally, CG-CCR geopolymer has a positive impact
  on the stress–strain relationship and strength of stabilized soil. This study demonstrates
  that CCR can be used as a partial replacement for NaOH in generating CG geopolymer,
  which can provide an effective path for disposing of CG and CCR as well as lead
  to more practical applications for geopolymer in soil stabilization. © 2021 Elsevier
