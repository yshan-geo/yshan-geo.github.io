abstract: Flexible joints represent the most vulnerable aspect of the immersed tunnel,
  necessitating effective waterproofing and the transmission of forces between tunnel
  segments. However, the role of longitudinal limit devices in the seismic behavior
  of immersed tunnels is frequently overlooked in contemporary research on their seismic
  robustness. This study develops a longitudinal force model for flexible joints that
  incorporates the longitudinal limit device, building upon the beam-spring model
  of the immersed tunnel. Concurrently, a scaled partial experiment on the immersed
  tunnel's flexible joint is undertaken, and validated and compared to the theoretical
  model. Subsequently, this model is utilized in the seismic assessment of the Ruyifang
  immersed tunnel. The computational findings revealed a considerable improvement
  in the seismic resilience of the immersed tunnel following the integration of longitudinal
  limit devices. With the incorporation of these devices, the opening of flexible
  joints diminished by 20% to 50% compared to scenarios lacking such devices. In addition,
  the peak acceleration of the tunnel segments’ mid-point structural response decreased
  by approximately 50%, accompanied by a significant reduction in the internal force
  response within the tunnel segments. As proposed in this research, the longitudinal
  force model for flexible joints under longitudinal limit devices represents the
  behavior of immersed tunnels under seismic stress more accurately. These numerical
  simulation outcomes also offer valuable insights for designing flexible joints in
  immersed tunnels. © 2024 Tongji University.
