abstract: Soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) is an important hydraulic property
  that describes the relationship between matric suction and water content in unsaturated
  soils. However, existing SWCC models for gap-graded soil are highly empirical and
  fail to account for the influence of soil physical properties on SWCC. SWCC models
  for continuous-graded soil don't consider the packing between particles, which results
  in predictions that are inconsistent with measured data. To solve the above limitation,
  this study proposed a new pore capillary model considering the packing of coarse
  and fine-grained soils and established a unimodal SWCC model called GU (Gap-graded
  soil and Unimodal SWCC) for gap-graded soil based on bimodal grain-size distribution
  (GSD) and fractal theory. There were only two physical fitting parameters in the
  GU model, pore fractal dimension and maximum adsorbed water content. The new proposed
  GU model was verified by published measured data and compared with SAP model, a
  representative SWCC theoretical model for continuous-graded soil. The verification
  and comparison prove that SWCCs predicted by the GU model have fewer error and a
  more reasonable variation trend than SWCCs predicted by the SAP model for different
  types of gap-graded soils. Thus, this study provides a novel approach to establish
  the relationship between soil properties and SWCC for gap-graded soil based on soil
  water retention mechanisms, which is important for subsequent studies of hydraulic
  properties. Â© 2024 Elsevier Ltd
