abstract: 'Small-strain damping is a key factor of soil behavior under cyclic loading:
  although the value of small-strain damping is such small that would not compete
  with damping at larger strains (that would have a more significant impact in dynamic
  response analyses), repeated energy consumption of the small-strain damping would
  bring potential abrupt structural failure of soil. However, the measurement methods
  and fitting models of small-strain damping vary in the accuracy and applicable scope.
  In this paper, the measurement of SHANTOU remolded saturated soft clay was made
  for small-strain damping by resonant column apparatus, using both resonant column
  test method and free vibration test method. On the basis of the experimental data,
  this paper made a comparison between the two methods and found out the free vibration
  test method was more favorable for damping measurement at small strains(10−4% < γ < 10−1%).
  Based on Davidenkov model, a modified model with the consideration of minimum damping
  ratio was presented for SHANTOU remolded saturated soft clay in this paper. © 2017,
