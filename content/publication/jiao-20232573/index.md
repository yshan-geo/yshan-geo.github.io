abstract: 'Thermokarst terrain is developing at an accelerating pace in the ice-rich
  permafrost on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), China, and the most dramatic of these
  terrain-altering thermokarsts is retrogressive thaw slump (RTS). The freeze–thaw
  erosion (FTE) impacts are sharply increasing on the Plateau due to RTS, especially
  as a result of the migration of fine sediments in cold climates, these impacts are
  still not quantified due to the limitation of hydro-thermal-mass transport laws
  in RTS development. Moreover, it is difficult to assess the impact of RTS on the
  ecology and environment, especially on soil erosion. This study developed a heat–water-mass
  transport coupled model of a RTS in the Beiluhe River Region on the QTP, considering
  the actual topography, water-ice phase change, latent heat, and surface heat exchange
  layer. Based on the observed data of ground temperature, unfrozen water content,
  and heat flux, the coupled model herein is practicable for presenting the geotemperature
  regime and groundwater flow in the RTS area, thereby quantifying the ice-rich permafrost
  thaw and mass wasting. The results presented indicate that: (1) the seepage velocity
  of the superficial zone (0–1.5 m depth) is two orders of magnitude higher than that
  of the permafrost table; (2) the mean ice-rich permafrost thaw volume was 13.4 m2
  from 2016 to 2021; and (3) the cumulative mass transport volume was 22 m2 from July
  2020 to September 2021. In addition, the relation between the FTE (shown as the
  migration of sediments) and the amount of ground ice ablation can be fitted by an
  exponential equation. This work proposes a reliable method for quantifying the effect
  of FTE and is helpful to assess the eco-environmental impacts of RTS. © 2023 John
