abstract: Marine clays are easily affected by different mineral composition in cyclic
  load-based geological hazards. Therefore, based on analyzing the mineral composition
  of natural marine clay, it is the key to predict the dynamic properties of natural
  materials under cyclic loading by using quantitated artificial marine clay. In this
  study, the marine clay found in the South China Sea deltas was investigated. Based
  on the results of geological conditions and mineral composition analyses, raw non-clay
  minerals (such as quartz, albite) and clay minerals (such as Na-montmorillonite
  and kaolinite) were used to produce artificial marine clay, the dynamic properties
  of which were studied from the impact of mineral composition. Dynamic triaxial laboratory
  testing for artificial marine clay comprising various clay minerals was performed
  under identical test conditions. The artificial marine clay with high montmorillonite
  content exhibited slower development of strain, more sluggish growth in pore water
  pressure, more rounded hysteresis curves, greater stiffness, and more prolonged
  viscous energy growth than the clay with low montmorillonite content. In addition,
  the flocculated fabric of the artificial marine clay with high montmorillonite content
  demonstrated sufficient pore space changes, more uniform pore distribution, and
  larger specific surface area than the dispersed fabric of the clay with low montmorillonite
  content. The factors arising from the influence of montmorillonite may lead to microstructural
  and fabric changes, hinder the development of pore water, and increase intergranular
  contact stiffness as well as delay the cyclic strain amplitude at the breakpoint
  of viscous energy dissipation. In general, the results presented in this study confirm
  that clay minerals, especially montmorillonite, have significant influence on the
  dynamic properties of large strain. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel,
