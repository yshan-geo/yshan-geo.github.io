abstract: To investigate the meso-fabric characteristics of calcareous sand (CS) under
  undrained shear conditions, multiple consolidated-undrained triaxial shear tests
  were conducted on CS under different effective confining pressures (σ3′), and the
  particle gradations and shapes of CS before and after triaxial shear tests were
  measured using screening tests and particle shape scanning tests, respectively.
  According to the results, (I) the consolidated-undrained triaxial shear tests on
  CS can be regarded as a process of transforming from weakening frictional strength
  to reinforcing cohesive strength. (II) The relative breakage ratio (Br) and modified
  relative breakage index (Br ∗) of CS both increased in power function form with
  increasing σ3′. The Br of CS was less than its Br ∗ under the same σ3′. The connection
  between the Br and plastic work of CS under undrained shear conditions was established.
  Splitting and abrasion were the main particle breakage patterns of CS during consolidated-undrained
  triaxial shear. (III) After consolidated-undrained triaxial shear tests, the particle
  shape of CS became increasingly regular. Due to the diversity of particle breakage
  patterns, the mean particle shape parameter of CS did not show any monotonic change
  with increasing σ3′. © 2022, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.
