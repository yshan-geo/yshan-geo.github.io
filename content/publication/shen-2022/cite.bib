 abstract = {To investigate the meso-fabric characteristics of calcareous sand (CS) under undrained shear conditions, multiple consolidated-undrained triaxial shear tests were conducted on CS under different effective confining pressures (σ3′), and the particle gradations and shapes of CS before and after triaxial shear tests were measured using screening tests and particle shape scanning tests, respectively. According to the results, (I) the consolidated-undrained triaxial shear tests on CS can be regarded as a process of transforming from weakening frictional strength to reinforcing cohesive strength. (II) The relative breakage ratio (Br) and modified relative breakage index (Br ∗) of CS both increased in power function form with increasing σ3′. The Br of CS was less than its Br ∗ under the same σ3′. The connection between the Br and plastic work of CS under undrained shear conditions was established. Splitting and abrasion were the main particle breakage patterns of CS during consolidated-undrained triaxial shear. (III) After consolidated-undrained triaxial shear tests, the particle shape of CS became increasingly regular. Due to the diversity of particle breakage patterns, the mean particle shape parameter of CS did not show any monotonic change with increasing σ3′. © 2022, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},
