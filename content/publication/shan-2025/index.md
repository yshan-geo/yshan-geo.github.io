abstract: Evaluating cyclic liquefaction of soil from the perspective of energy dissipation
  provides a more comprehensive insight into its liquefaction mechanism. This study
  conducted a series of undrained cyclic triaxial tests using discrete element method
  to investigate the influence of plastic fines content (FC) on the dynamic characteristics
  of sand-clay mixtures. A new evaluation index, the Viscous Energy Dissipation Ratio
  (VEDR), is introduced to assess the energy dissipation performance of sand-clay
  mixtures. Macroscopically, it is shown that when FC < 30 %, increasing the fines
  content promotes the development of strain and pore water pressure, leading to a
  decrease in dynamic strength. However, when FC > 30 %, the trend reverses. In terms
  of energy dissipation, as the fines content increases, VEDR gradually transitions
  from the sand-like to the clay-like mode, exhibiting a unique transitional mode
  when FC = 50 %. Microscopically, the development of bond breakage is highly similar
  to that of VEDR. The bond breakage facilitates particle sliding and rolling, which
  is the fundamental factor causing the differences of energy dissipation between
  pure sand and sand-clay mixtures. This paper contributes to the mechanistic study
  of liquefaction criteria based on energy theory by establishing the connection between
  microscopic particle behavior and macroscopic energy dissipation during the cyclic
  liquefaction process. Â© 2024
