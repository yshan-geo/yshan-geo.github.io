abstract: Reasonable determination of the cyclic resistance of low-plasticity fine-grained
  tailings is important for the engineering design of new tailings dams. In this paper,
  a series of monotonic and cyclic triaxial undrained tests were conducted to investigate
  the mechanical response of low-plasticity fine-grained tailings (Taiping tailings).
  A unified Viscous Energy Dissipation Ratio (VEDR) was then used to develop an energy-based
  method to study the failure mode under cyclic loading. The VEDR is a normalized
  energy ratio based on the relationship between cyclic stress and strain. Collapse
  failure was observed when the dynamic properties suddenly changed beyond the peak
  point of VEDR (VEDRpeak). These changes included a sudden decrease in VEDR, an abrupt
  increase in cyclic amplitude strain (εcyc), and the prominent failure pattern of
  hysteresis curve. In this regard, VEDR failure criterion was proposed by considering
  VEDRpeak as the failure point. Comparisons based on the effective stress path and
  the cyclic resistance ratio (CRR) indicate that the VEDR failure criterion is more
  suitable for determining the CRR than conventional strain-based failure criteria
  for Taiping tailings. Furthermore, a relationship between the VEDR failure criterion
  and strain-based failure criterion was introduced. In general, the VEDR failure
  criterion will provide an insight into the determination of CRR for low-plasticity
  fine-grained tailings. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.
