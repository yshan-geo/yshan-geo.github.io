abstract: The new damping ratio can accurately estimate the value of damping ratio
  at peak strength. The linear energy damping law enables the calculation of damping
  strain energy density at peak strength. The linear relationship between AE energy
  and strain energy is used to prove the energy conversion theory of viscoelastic
  plastic rocks. Stress history significantly affects the linear energy storage law
  fitting parameter B and the |B/A|. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag
  GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2025.; The damping ratio of rocks is essential
  for evaluating rock mass stability under dynamic loads. This study investigates
  energy evolution and damping characteristics through single cyclic loading–unloading
  uniaxial compression tests and acoustic emission (AE) monitoring on sandstone and
  granite, considering stress history. A strong linear relationship between cumulative
  AE energy and cumulative damage energy validates the theory of viscoelastic-plastic
  energy conversion in rocks. Additionally, the study discovered the linear energy
  damping (LED) law, characterized by a consistent linear relationship between damping
  energy and input energy, and a constant linear energy damping coefficient (LEDC)
  defined by linear fitting parameter A. Based on the LED law, two damping ratio calculation
  formulas (λLED,i=(A2ui+B2)/π(A1ui+B1), λI-LED=A2/πA1) were proposed. The results
  showed that the LED law enables the calculation of damping strain energy density
  at peak strength. The LEDC serves as an effective parameter for characterizing the
  damping capacity of various rock types λLED,i represents the evolution curve of
  the damping ratio, while λI-LED provides accurate estimates of the damping ratio
  at peak strength compared to traditional methods and reflects reliable stability.
  Stress history significantly affects the linear energy storage law fitting parameter
  B and the |B/A|. The research findings offer a novel method for calculating the
  energy relationship and damping ratio under ultimate stress states, enhancing the
  reliability of geotechnical engineering designs, and reducing disaster risks. ©
