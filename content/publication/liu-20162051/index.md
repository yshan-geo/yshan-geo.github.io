abstract: By using the stress-controlled undrained dynamic triaxial cyclic shear tests,
  relationship between accumulative energy dissipation of tailing soil and pore water
  pressure is investigated based on the critical factors, namely, cyclic stress ratio
  and consolidation stress ratio. The test results indicate that, during the process
  of cyclic shear, the increase of pore water pressure is closely related to the accumulative
  energy dissipation of plastic strain and viscous properties. A critical state, when
  the cyclic stress ratio Ŗ varies within the range of 0.205~0.238 and the consolidation
  stress ratio Ķ varies in 1.0~1.3, occurs between the pore water pressure and energy.
  Therefore, through nonlinear regression analysis, the energy model for pore water
  pressure of saturated tailing soil is preliminarily established based on the cyclic
  stress ratio and the axial-radial consolidation stress ratio, and it can be adequately
  employed to demonstrate the variations of pore water pressure without considering
  the uncertainty of cyclic loading number which can otherwise hinder the establishment
  of the model. In addition, the proposed model may also be a valuable source of reference
  for predicting the development of pore water pressure of saturated soil under cyclic
  loading. © 2016, Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Geotechnical Engineering.
