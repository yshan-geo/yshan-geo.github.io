abstract: Microbial-induced calcite precipitation (MICP) is a promising method to
  improve geotechnical engineering properties. In this context, little research has
  been conducted on the creep behavior of MICP-treated sand. Therefore, the present
  work performed direct shear creep tests to investigate the creep-related mechanical
  properties of silica sand and calcareous sand grouted three, six, and nine times
  in the MICP treatment. Compared to the untreated sand, the creep deformation of
  the MICP-treated silica sand grouted three and six times was more significant, and
  the creep deformation of the MICP-treated silica sand grouted nine times decreased
  by 88.0%, indicating that the treatment of the silica sand with the MICP could reduce
  its creep deformation. The creep deformation of the MICP-treated calcareous sand
  was larger than that of the untreated calcareous sand except for the sample grouted
  three times which had a creep deformation equivalent to that of the untreated calcareous
  sand, implying that the treatment of the calcareous sand with the MICP could increase
  its creep deformation. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images demonstrated
  that the calcium carbonate produced by microorganisms in the voids formed a connection
  between the sand particles as the critical factor affecting the creep behavior of
  the MICP-treated silica sand. In the case of the calcareous sand, the cavities were
  filled up with calcium carbonate, which decreased the effect of the interlocking
  structure of the sand particles. Â© 2022, Iran University of Science and Technology.
