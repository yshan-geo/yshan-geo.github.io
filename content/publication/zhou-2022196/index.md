abstract: In order to perfect the finite element model of longitudinal dynamic analysis
  of buried pipeline, the influence of internal pressure on dynamic response of buried
  pipeline was determined. Based on the seismic engineering of underground pipelines
  of coastal cities, numerical tests of dynamic response were carried out based on
  Longitudinal response displacement method. The similarities and differences of the
  two models were compared and analyzed. At the same time, the effects of seismic
  wave type and operating internal pressure on stress, strain and displacement response
  of pipelines were determined. The results show that both models are able to make
  a reasonable response, and the shell-spring model is more suitable for the work
  and intuitively shows the deformation of the pipeline structure. The existence of
  the internal pressure of buried pipeline ring has great significant influence on
  the stress and strain, and axial seismic response is mainly controlled by imported
  vibration. The research results can provide a more reliable and perfect calculation
  model and design basis for the response analysis and seismic design of buried pipelines
  under earthquake action. © 2022 Science Press. All rights reserved.
