 abstract = {In order to perfect the finite element model of longitudinal dynamic analysis of buried pipeline, the influence of internal pressure on dynamic response of buried pipeline was determined. Based on the seismic engineering of underground pipelines of coastal cities, numerical tests of dynamic response were carried out based on Longitudinal response displacement method. The similarities and differences of the two models were compared and analyzed. At the same time, the effects of seismic wave type and operating internal pressure on stress, strain and displacement response of pipelines were determined. The results show that both models are able to make a reasonable response, and the shell-spring model is more suitable for the work and intuitively shows the deformation of the pipeline structure. The existence of the internal pressure of buried pipeline ring has great significant influence on the stress and strain, and axial seismic response is mainly controlled by imported vibration. The research results can provide a more reliable and perfect calculation model and design basis for the response analysis and seismic design of buried pipelines under earthquake action. © 2022 Science Press.
