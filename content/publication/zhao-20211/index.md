abstract: Microbial-induced calcite precipitation (MICP) has been a promising method
  to improve geotechnical engineering properties through the precipitation of calcium
  carbonate (CaCO3 ) on the contact and surface of soil particles in recent years.
  In the present experiment, water absorption and unconfined compressive strength
  (UCS) tests were carried out to investigate the effects of three different fiber
  types (glass fiber, polyester fiber, and hemp fiber) on the physical and mechanical
  properties of MICP-treated calcareous sand. The fibers used were at 0%, 0.10%, 0.15%,
  0.20%, 0.25%, 0.30%, 0.35%, and 0.40% relative to the weight of the sand. The results
  showed that the failure strain and ductility of the samples could be improved by
  adding fibers. Compared to biocemented sand (BS), the water absorption of these
  three fiber-reinforced biocemented sands were, respectively, decreased by 11.60%,
  21.18%, and 7.29%. UCS was, respectively, increased by 24.20%, 60.76%, and 6.40%.
  Polyester fiber produced the best effect, followed by glass fiber and hemp fiber.
  The optimum contents of glass fiber and polyester fiber were 0.20% and 0.25%, respectively.
  The optimum content of hemp fiber was within the range of 0.20–0.25%. Light-emitting
  diode (LED) microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images lead to the
  conclusion that only a little calcite precipitation had occurred around the hemp
  fiber, leading to a poor bonding effect compared to the glass and polyester fibers.
  It was therefore suggested that polyester fiber should be used to improve the properties
  of biocemented sand. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.
