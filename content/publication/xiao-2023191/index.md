abstract: To study the propagation and attenuation characteristics of Rayleigh waves
  on the irregular seabed in saturated elastic half-space，a simplified dynamic model
  of irregular seabed sites is established with the fundamental equation of soil dynamics
  proposed by Zienkiewicz. By changing the boundary conditions，the Rayleigh equations
  are derived for the degradation model of uncovered seawater and overlying seawater
  when the water-soil contact interface is flat. And the dispersion and attenuation
  curves of Rayleigh waves under the influence of permeability coefficient，porosity，Poisson's
  ratio，and interface conditions are given. Based on the complex sea bed model，the
  effect of various factors on the dynamic response of seabed parameters，such as pore
  pressure and deformation during Rayleigh wave propagation，is analyzed. The results
  show that the soil mechanical parameters，such as elasticity modulus，permeability
  coefficient，and porosity，as well as the overlying water and the interface of sediment
  water，all affect the dynamic response of the seabed. The influence range and extent
  of different Rayleigh wave velocities on soil mechanical parameters differ along
  the soil depth. Elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio are important parameters that
  determine the properties of soil and are prerequisites for discussing the propagation
  characteristics of Rayleigh waves and the dynamic response of the soil. Their change
  affects the influence law of permeability coefficient，porosity，and other parameters.
  In the two simplified models，when the elastic modulus of the rock stratum is 6.017×1010
  Pa and Poisson’s ratio is 0.38，the porosity and permeability coefficient have regular
  effects on the propagation characteristics of Rayleigh waves. © 2023 Hunan University.
