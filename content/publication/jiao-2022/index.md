abstract: Ice-rich permafrost in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), China, is becoming
  susceptible to thermokarst landforms, and the most dramatic among these terrain-altering
  landforms is retrogressive thaw slump (RTS). Concurrently, RTS development can in
  turn affect the eco-environment, and especially soil erosion and carbon emission,
  during their evolution. However, there are still a lack of quantitative methods
  and comprehensive studies on the deformation and volumetric change in RTS. The purpose
  of this study is to quantitatively assess the RTS evolution through a novel and
  feasible simulation framework of the GPU-based discrete element method (DEM) coupled
  with the finite difference method (FDM). Additionally, the simulation results were
  calibrated using the time series observation results from September 2021 to August
  2022, using the combined methods of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and unmanned
  aerial vehicle (UAV). The results reveal that, over this time, thaw slump mobilized
  a total volume of 1335 m3 and approximately 1050 m3 moved to a displaced area. Additionally,
  the estimated soil erosion was about 211 m3. Meanwhile, the corresponding maximum
  ground subsidence and headwall retrogression were 1.9 m and 3.2 m, respectively.
  We also found that the amount of mass wasting in RTS development is highly related
  to the ground ice content. When the volumetric ice content exceeds 10%, there will
  be obvious mass wasting in the thaw slump development area. Furthermore, this work
  proposed that the coupled DEM-FDM method and field survey method of TLS-UAV can
  provide an effective pathway to simulate thaw-induced slope failure problems and
  complement the research limitations of small-scale RTSs using remote sensing methods.
  The results are meaningful for assessing the eco-environmental impacts on the QTP.
