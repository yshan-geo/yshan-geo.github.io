abstract: Currently, the mechanical properties of calcareous sand are mainly studied
  through triaxial tests, as traditional uniaxial compression tests fail to capture
  real loading conditions and soil strength anisotropy. To address this, true triaxial
  tests were conducted to examine the effect of the intermediate principal stress
  parameter (b) on the three-dimensional strength and deformation behavior of calcareous
  sand. In the constant b and σ3 tests, as the b value increased, both the strength
  and peak friction angle (φps) of calcareous sand were increased, while the tangent
  slope of the dilatancy curve showed a gradual rise. The φps of calcareous sand was
  found to be higher compared to silica sand and coarse-grained soils. In the constant
  mean effective stress (p) and b test, the strength was increased with higher values
  of both b and p. The Matsuoka-Nakai 3D strength criterion proved more effective
  in fitting the 3D strength of calcareous sand in π plane. As the b value increased,
  the critical stress ratio (Mc) was decreased. A quadratic function can better represent
  the Mc of calcareous sand in the π plane under varying confining pressures. Furthermore,
  the Mc of calcareous sand was higher than that of silica sand and completely decomposed
  granite soil. This study provides a valuable experimental basis for understanding
  the 3D strength and deformation characteristics of calcareous sand in oceanic engineering
  infrastructure. © The Author(s) 2025.
