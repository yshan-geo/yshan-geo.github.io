	abstract = {Reasonable determination of the cyclic resistance of low-plasticity fine-grained tailings is important for the engineering design of new tailings dams. In this paper, a series of monotonic and cyclic triaxial undrained tests were conducted to investigate the mechanical response of low-plasticity fine-grained tailings (Taiping tailings). A unified Viscous Energy Dissipation Ratio (VEDR) was then used to develop an energy-based method to study the failure mode under cyclic loading. The VEDR is a normalized energy ratio based on the relationship between cyclic stress and strain. Collapse failure was observed when the dynamic properties suddenly changed beyond the peak point of VEDR (VEDRpeak). These changes included a sudden decrease in VEDR, an abrupt increase in cyclic amplitude strain (εcyc), and the prominent failure pattern of hysteresis curve. In this regard, VEDR failure criterion was proposed by considering VEDRpeak as the failure point. Comparisons based on the effective stress path and the cyclic resistance ratio (CRR) indicate that the VEDR failure criterion is more suitable for determining the CRR than conventional strain-based failure criteria for Taiping tailings. Furthermore, a relationship between the VEDR failure criterion and strain-based failure criterion was introduced. In general, the VEDR failure criterion will provide an insight into the determination of CRR for low-plasticity fine-grained tailings. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Steel frame structures often use exposed column-base plate connections. Studies on such connections have mainly focused on the mechanical properties along the strong axis. Thus, the seismic performance evaluation for the weak axis direction, which may cause insufficient structural safety, has been underestimated. The present study discusses the results of eight cyclic loading tests along the minor axis of exposed column-base plate connections. Then, the effects of the axial compression ratio, the size of the column section, the diameter and the arrangement of anchor bolts, the thickness of the base plate, and any stiffeners on the connection's seismic performance are quantified. It was found that the failure mode is breaking of the anchor bolts except for two specimens with torn welding lines. Also, all hysteretic curves are the slip type with the highest ductility coefficient of 10.49. The experimental results are used to build a numerical model based on the finite element method. Also, the stiffness calculation formula for the weak axis direction is derived using the component method. In addition, a technique for predicting a column's moment-rotation curve is proposed. It will be shown that the results of this technique agree well with those of the finite element model and with the experimental data. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Microbial-induced calcite precipitation (MICP) is a promising method to improve geotechnical engineering properties. In this context, little research has been conducted on the creep behavior of MICP-treated sand. Therefore, the present work performed direct shear creep tests to investigate the creep-related mechanical properties of silica sand and calcareous sand grouted three, six, and nine times in the MICP treatment. Compared to the untreated sand, the creep deformation of the MICP-treated silica sand grouted three and six times was more significant, and the creep deformation of the MICP-treated silica sand grouted nine times decreased by 88.0%, indicating that the treatment of the silica sand with the MICP could reduce its creep deformation. The creep deformation of the MICP-treated calcareous sand was larger than that of the untreated calcareous sand except for the sample grouted three times which had a creep deformation equivalent to that of the untreated calcareous sand, implying that the treatment of the calcareous sand with the MICP could increase its creep deformation. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images demonstrated that the calcium carbonate produced by microorganisms in the voids formed a connection between the sand particles as the critical factor affecting the creep behavior of the MICP-treated silica sand. In the case of the calcareous sand, the cavities were filled up with calcium carbonate, which decreased the effect of the interlocking structure of the sand particles. © 2022, Iran University of Science and Technology.},

	abstract = {Microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) is a new, natural, environmentally friendly treatment method for soil foundations, which can improve the resistance of calcareous sand foundations to liquefaction. Liquefaction is prone to occur under dynamic loading caused by events such as earthquakes or sea waves. Activated carbon is a porous substance that also offers the property of adsorption. In this study, the adsorption capacity of activated carbon was used to improve the retention ratio of bacteria during MICP treatment. Bacterial retention tests, cyclic triaxial (CTX) tests, and microscopic scanning tests were carried out to investigate the effects of variable activated carbon contents (namely 0%, 0.25%, 0.75%, 0.50%, 1.00%, and 1.25%, relative to the weight of the sand) on the liquefaction resistance of MICP-treated calcareous sand. The results showed that with the increasing activated carbon, the number of cycles of excess pore water pressure in the cumulative stage of the samples was increased, and the amplitude of axial strain was decreased. As the activated carbon content was increased, the bacterial retention ratio, cyclic strength, and secant modulus of the samples were found to improve considerably. On examination of microscopic scanning images, it was observed that the distribution of excessive activated carbon between the sand particles had resulted in it occupying the bacterial nucleation site and creating an obstacle to the connection between sand particles. The test using 0.75% activated carbon content best enhanced the resistance to liquefaction of calcareous sand. The outcome of this study may in the authors’ view prove beneficial in improving the bacterial retention ratio and liquefaction resistance of calcareous sand when it is reinforced by microorganisms. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Marine clays are easily affected by different mineral composition in cyclic load-based geological hazards. Therefore, based on analyzing the mineral composition of natural marine clay, it is the key to predict the dynamic properties of natural materials under cyclic loading by using quantitated artificial marine clay. In this study, the marine clay found in the South China Sea deltas was investigated. Based on the results of geological conditions and mineral composition analyses, raw non-clay minerals (such as quartz, albite) and clay minerals (such as Na-montmorillonite and kaolinite) were used to produce artificial marine clay, the dynamic properties of which were studied from the impact of mineral composition. Dynamic triaxial laboratory testing for artificial marine clay comprising various clay minerals was performed under identical test conditions. The artificial marine clay with high montmorillonite content exhibited slower development of strain, more sluggish growth in pore water pressure, more rounded hysteresis curves, greater stiffness, and more prolonged viscous energy growth than the clay with low montmorillonite content. In addition, the flocculated fabric of the artificial marine clay with high montmorillonite content demonstrated sufficient pore space changes, more uniform pore distribution, and larger specific surface area than the dispersed fabric of the clay with low montmorillonite content. The factors arising from the influence of montmorillonite may lead to microstructural and fabric changes, hinder the development of pore water, and increase intergranular contact stiffness as well as delay the cyclic strain amplitude at the breakpoint of viscous energy dissipation. In general, the results presented in this study confirm that clay minerals, especially montmorillonite, have significant influence on the dynamic properties of large strain. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the measurement methods and fitting models of small-strain damping vary in the accuracy and applicable scope. In this paper, the measurement of SHANTOU remolded saturated soft clay was made for small-strain damping by resonant column apparatus, using both resonant column test method and free vibration test method. On the basis of the experimental data, this paper made a comparison between the two methods and found out the free vibration test method was more favorable for damping measurement at small strains(10−4% < γ < 10−1%).

	abstract = {Thermokarst terrain is developing at an accelerating pace in the ice-rich permafrost on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), China, and the most dramatic of these terrain-altering thermokarsts is retrogressive thaw slump (RTS). The freeze–thaw erosion (FTE) impacts are sharply increasing on the Plateau due to RTS, especially as a result of the migration of fine sediments in cold climates, these impacts are still not quantified due to the limitation of hydro-thermal-mass transport laws in RTS development. Moreover, it is difficult to assess the impact of RTS on the ecology and environment, especially on soil erosion. This study developed a heat–water-mass transport coupled model of a RTS in the Beiluhe River Region on the QTP, considering the actual topography, water-ice phase change, latent heat, and surface heat exchange layer. Based on the observed data of ground temperature, unfrozen water content, and heat flux, the coupled model herein is practicable for presenting the geotemperature regime and groundwater flow in the RTS area, thereby quantifying the ice-rich permafrost thaw and mass wasting. The results presented indicate that: (1) the seepage velocity of the superficial zone (0–1.5 m depth) is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the permafrost table; (2) the mean ice-rich permafrost thaw volume was 13.4 m2 from 2016 to 2021; and (3) the cumulative mass transport volume was 22 m2 from July 2020 to September 2021. In addition, the relation between the FTE (shown as the migration of sediments) and the amount of ground ice ablation can be fitted by an exponential equation. This work proposes a reliable method for quantifying the effect of FTE and is helpful to assess the eco-environmental impacts of RTS. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) is a new foundation treatment technology, which can improve the mechanical properties of soil. In this study, sand specimens containing different magnesium/calcium ion concentration ratios (Mg2+/Ca2+=0/0.5, 0.1/0.4, 0.2/0.3, 0.25/0.25, 0.4/0.1, and 0.5/0) were selected. Moreover, the effects of magnesium ions on the mechanical properties and mechanism of the biocemented sand were explored by oedometer tests, unconfined compressive strength tests, cyclic triaxial tests, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that when the Mg2+ concentration is low, with increasing Mg2+/Ca2+, the compressibility of the biocemented sand decreases, the unconfined compressive strength increases, and the antiliquefaction performance improves. When Mg2+/Ca2+=0.2/0.3, the sand specimen showed the worst compressibility and the best unconfined compressive strength and antiliquefaction performance. When the Mg2+ concentration was high, all the mechanical properties of the specimen were weakened. Low Mg2+ concentrations promote the formation of aragonite, whereas high Mg2+ concentrations promote the formation of dolomite.

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to understand the collapse mechanism of a shallow tunnel based on the upper bound analysis method, considering the variational approach for the problem with variable endpoints. The virtual power equation of upper bound theorem and Hoek-Brown criterion are combined to analyze the overlying rock mass, and the expression of collapse curve is obtained. Compared with the collapse curves solved by the variational method of the fixed endpoints problem in other studies, the advantage of this method is to consider the effect of the variable endpoints on the collapse curve, which is able to model the problem in a more realistic manner. The results show that the collapse curves obtained by the variational method of the variable endpoints problem are smaller than that of the existing study which are solved by the variational method of the fixed endpoints problem. The results also indicate that the width of excavation needs to be sufficiently small and the support for the overlying rock mass needs to be sufficiently large to prevent collapse. In general, these results will help to provide safe design and construction guidance for engineering practice. © 2022},

	abstract = {Evaluating cyclic liquefaction of soil from the perspective of energy dissipation provides a more comprehensive insight into its liquefaction mechanism. This study conducted a series of undrained cyclic triaxial tests using discrete element method to investigate the influence of plastic fines content (FC) on the dynamic characteristics of sand-clay mixtures. A new evaluation index, the Viscous Energy Dissipation Ratio (VEDR), is introduced to assess the energy dissipation performance of sand-clay mixtures. Macroscopically, it is shown that when FC < 30 %, increasing the fines content promotes the development of strain and pore water pressure, leading to a decrease in dynamic strength. However, when FC > 30 %, the trend reverses. In terms of energy dissipation, as the fines content increases, VEDR gradually transitions from the sand-like to the clay-like mode, exhibiting a unique transitional mode when FC = 50 %. Microscopically, the development of bond breakage is highly similar to that of VEDR. The bond breakage facilitates particle sliding and rolling, which is the fundamental factor causing the differences of energy dissipation between pure sand and sand-clay mixtures. This paper contributes to the mechanistic study of liquefaction criteria based on energy theory by establishing the connection between microscopic particle behavior and macroscopic energy dissipation during the cyclic liquefaction process. © 2024},

According to the results, (I) the consolidated-undrained triaxial shear tests on CS can be regarded as a process of transforming from weakening frictional strength to reinforcing cohesive strength. (II) The relative breakage ratio (Br) and modified relative breakage index (Br ∗) of CS both increased in power function form with increasing σ3′. The Br of CS was less than its Br ∗ under the same σ3′. The connection between the Br and plastic work of CS under undrained shear conditions was established. Splitting and abrasion were the main particle breakage patterns of CS during consolidated-undrained triaxial shear. (III) After consolidated-undrained triaxial shear tests, the particle shape of CS became increasingly regular. Due to the diversity of particle breakage patterns, the mean particle shape parameter of CS did not show any monotonic change with increasing σ3′. © 2022, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Reexamining the transitional failure with energy method is a new idea of studying the dynamic properties of fine-grained soil. In this paper, a series of undrained cyclic triaxial tests and low-vacuum environmental scanning electron microscopy were employed to study the dynamic properties of two types of clay–sand mixtures with a similar plasticity index at a fine-grained content of 70%. In terms of mineral composition, Toyoura sand constituted the coarse-grained fraction of the clay–sand mixture, and its fine-grained portion was comprised of different mass ratios of quartz, albite, Na-montmorillonite, and kaolinite (Qc:Ac:Mc:Kc); that is, the specimens were divided into groups T-Q42.5A42.5M0K15 and T-Q45A45M2.5K7.5. The results showed that T-Q42.5A42.5M0K15 with an embedded dispersed fabric had a failure mode dominated by the pore water pressure, so it had an inferior cyclic strength compared to T-Q45A45M2.5K7.5 with an embedded flocculated fabric. Meanwhile, the dimensionless viscous energy dissipation ratio (VEDR) was introduced to observe the history of the differential energy dissipation of the clay–sand mixture and thus reveal the limitations of the plasticity index for the evaluation of the dynamic properties of soil. Furthermore, compared with previously studied artificial marine clay with a clay-like mode of VEDR and low-plasticity fine-grained tailings with a sand-like mode of VEDR, the clay–sand mixture studied herein offered a transitional mode of VEDR. On the whole, this work can make a significant contribution to the research on transitional failure by demonstrating that traditional dynamic properties and energy dissipation can act together as the indicators of the dynamic behavior of soil. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

This study conducts systematic monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests, along with a series of microscopic tests on WGS samples, to explore the influence of weathering on WGS mechanical properties and the mechanism of granite weathering. Results indicate that both effective internal friction angle and effective cohesion decrease progressively with increased weathering. Completely weathered granite (CWG) exhibits greater dynamic strength compared to granite residual soil (GRS). Additionally, as weathering progresses, quartz fragments are lost, while feldspar and biotite weather to form secondary minerals such as kaolinite and illite, leading to an overall enrichment in aluminum and iron in the granite. Weathering causes structural deterioration of WGS. Finally, the mechanical parameters of WGS and their chemical weathering indices show a coefficient of determination ranging from 60 to 99%. This study helps elucidate the fundamental causes of performance changes in WGS, thereby optimizing engineering design and enhancing disaster prediction accuracy, while providing new research perspectives and experimental evidence for WGS. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Degradation mechanisms were studied using XRD, FTIR, TGA, MIP, and SEM to analyze erosion products, microstructure, and pore evolution. An optimal liquid-to-solid ratio of 0.45 was identified for CG–CCR geopolymers. The material exhibited excellent resistance to Na2SO4 due to ettringite and C-A-S-H gel formation, enhancing pore structure and bonding strength. However, resistance to H2SO4 and MgSO4 was poor, driven by aluminum and calcium leaching and C-A-S-H transformation into non-cementitious M-A-S-H gels. A dense protective layer and corrosion-resistant C-A-S-H gel provided superior durability compared to OPC, with CCR addition further improving structural integrity and C-A-S-H gel generation.

	abstract = {The reexamination of the failure of the fine-grained soils through the laboratory undrained cyclic loading tests demonstrates that some special fine-grained soils follow a different failure pattern. Indeed, compared with typical fine-grained soils, these special fine-grained soils show an obvious “collapse failure” pattern. In this context, five basic dynamic properties of the fine-grained soils with a collapse failure characteristic, namely the axial (or shear) strain, the excess pore water pressure, the effective cyclic stress path, the hysteresis curve, and the viscous energy dissipation, are described in detail, and all the properties indicate the characteristics of collapse failure in the final loading stage. The reinvestigation of the traditional behaviour classification suggests that the behaviour of the fine-grained soils with a collapse failure characteristic can be classified as either “cyclic mobility with limited liquefaction” or “cyclic mobility with larger liquefaction potential” that shows more pronounced liquefaction characteristics. Additionally, the assessment of the soil indexes of the fine-grained soils with a collapse failure characteristic reveals a certain regularity in their particle size characteristics; in fact, the clay content, the plasticity index, and the ratio of the water content to the liquid limit of the fine-grained soils range from 3.0 to 20.0%, from 0 to 9.6, and from 0.85 to 1.11 respectively. The results of the current work confirm that the fine-grained soils with limited ranges of the soil indexes have the potential to exhibit collapse failure. The findings obtained herein make a major contribution to our understanding of the collapse failure of fine-grained soils. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Soil liquefaction is relevant to the development of excess pore water pressure and strain, as well as the energy dissipation in the soils. A series of cyclic triaxial undrained tests are conducted on a typical low-plasticity fine-grained soil (Taiping tailings) to evaluate cyclic response at different cyclic stress levels. There are four testing samples subjected to different cyclic stress ratios on the condition of the same void ratio. A unified viscous energy dissipation ratio (VEDR), which is a normalized energy ratio based on the relationship between cyclic stress and strain, is proposed to study the energy dissipation at each cycle. In general, growth trends of cyclic strain amplitude (ϵcyc), excess pore water pressure ratio (ru), and VEDR for testing samples depend on the applied cyclic stress levels. And the variations of VEDR versus ϵcyc and ru indicate VEDR is not only related to strain and excess pore water pressure development levels but also can reflect the triggering of excess pore water pressure and threshold strain (close to 0.02%). Additionally, the VEDR results can provide a meaningful basis to study the specific particle behaviors in the process of cyclic loading. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {The architectural relics of ancient vernacular residences and villages with brick–timber structures are at great risk of fire; if one occurs, they cannot be recovered. To protect this cultural heritage, this study takes a southern Guangdong He Xinwu building complex as a case study. It focuses on four indicator systems: human factors, facility factors, environmental factors, and social management factors, and 20 sub-indicators to establish an assessment system for fire risk in vernacular residences. Combining triangular fuzzy hierarchical analysis and the entropy weight method to determine weight values reduces evaluation subjectivity, allowing for both qualitative and quantitative measurements to derive the safety level and determine key fire risk factors. The results showed that human misconduct and social management of fire had the greatest impact on fire risk (29% and 25.8%, respectively). The most important secondary indicators were the ability to fight fires early on, the fire resistance level of building materials, fire rescue capability, fire load, and electricity use by villagers. Moreover, comparing differences in protection between ancient houses and high-rise buildings provided targeted policy recommendations that offer a new perspective for protecting architectural heritage from fires. © 2023 by the authors.},

This study employs the Ruyifang tunnel as its research object to determine the most dangerous cross-section. It establishes a two-dimensional soil-structure interaction system for complex sites to evaluate immersed tunnels' safety during earthquakes, clarify the structural failure mechanism, and optimize the backfilling scheme. In addition, this study investigates the tunnel element's response, damage, and stress under static and dynamic loads and obtains the impact of backfilling materials by considering plastic damage in structures, soil viscoelastic properties, and various backfilling schemes. The results showed that the tunnel section's stress has prominently distributed characteristics. Moreover, the structure exhibits tensile failure during ground motions, and the bottom of the side wall is the critical area. The inertial force is the primary factor affecting the seismic capacity at the overburden layer and flanks, while stiffness plays a vital role at the cushion.

	abstract = {Evaluating the cyclic strength development using energy-based methods is a novel concept in studying the dynamic properties of sand-clay mixtures under cyclic loading. In this study, a series of undrained cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on sand-clay mixtures, and the performance of different fine-grain contents on the dynamic properties and the energy dissipation of sand-clay mixtures was investigated based on the energy-based methods. The results demonstrated a gradual increase in the cyclic strain amplitude and the residual axial strain with increasing fines content (FC) under cyclic loading with a controlled cyclic stress ratio; in contrast, the accumulation of pore-water pressure slowed down. An initial decrease in the cyclic strength of the mixtures was observed with an increase in their fines contents; however, further increasing the FC enlarged the cyclic strength of the sand-clay mixtures. This transition was observed when the threshold fines content reached about 30%. The viscous energy dissipation ratio (VEDR), which is a nondimensional energy ratio based on the relationship between cyclic stress and strain and reflects the characteristics of dynamic properties, was utilized to compare three critical phase transition points, namely, VEDRvalley, VEDRpeak, and VEDR5%strain, in the energy dissipation of the sand-clay mixtures. Based on the VEDR results, the cyclic strength development indexes were established. Furthermore, low-vacuum environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed that as the FC increased, the particle composition of the sand-clay mixtures transitioned from predominantly coarse-grained to fine-grained, resulting in a change in the cyclic behavior of the mixtures from sandlike to claylike. The cyclic strength development indices provided further insights into and quantified the effect of fines contents of the sand-clay mixtures on their cyclic strength development process. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {The microbially induced calcite precipitation(MICP) is a reinforcement technique aiming at reducing carbon emissions and pollution，and it can effectively enhance the dynamic properties of sandy soils. The MICP is applied to strengthen calcareous sand samples in the South China Sea region. A series of resonant column tests and scanning electron microscope tests are conducted to thoroughly investigate the impact of particle size(d50)，uniformity coefficient(Cu)，and curvature coefficient(Cc) on the maximum dynamic shear modulus(Gmax) of MICP-treated sandy soils. The experiment results indicate that the Gmax of untreated sand increases with increasing d50，decreases with increasing Cu，and initially decreases and then increases with increasing Cc. Meanwhile，the Gmax of the MICP-treated sand maintains the same relationship with Cu and Cc of the untreated sand，but it increases initially and then decreases with increasing d50. Furthermore，the MICP cementing effect correlates with the calcium carbonate content ， with differences in calcium carbonate content attributed to variations in particle size and uniformity of particle gradation，which mainly influence bacterial retention through differences in pore number and volume. Separate Gmax prediction models considering particle size and gradation characteristics are proposed，with a large amount of literature data used to verify the validity and applicability of the proposed models，depending on whether the initial pore ratio corrected for calcium carbonate content is taken into account. The experimental study provides a theoretical basis for the practical engineering application of MICP to improve the dynamic properties in calcareous sands. © 2024 Academia Sinica.

	abstract = {Calcareous sand foundations may be damaged by waves or earthquakes. Therefore, such foundations should be reinforced. In this study, a series of bacterial solution tests and cyclic triaxial tests were performed to investigate the reinforcing effect of microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) treatment of calcareous sand in different NaCl concentrations. In bacterial solution tests, the microbial activity and microbial mineralization products were examined. At 32 hr, the OD600 and urease of MAT35 were lower than MAT0 by 21.94% and 43.53%. In 0–48 hr, the OD600 and activity of MAT80 and MAT100 were below 0.15 and 1 mM urea/min. The productivity of calcium carbonate after MICP decreased with an increase in NaCl concentration. The cyclic triaxial tests showed that with an increase in NaCl concentration, the accumulation rate of pore pressure increased, and the number of strain-accumulation cycles decreased. Although the stiffness and cyclic resistance of the samples decreased with an increase in NaCl concentration, both were higher than those of untreated sands. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that as the NaCl concentration increased, the calcium carbonate was precipitated gradually changed from a cluster to individual crystals; this change in form is the main reason for the decrease in liquefaction resistance. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Granite undergoes varying degrees of weathering when subjected to weathering processes, resulting in weathered granite soil (WGS) with different degrees of weathering. This study focuses on granite residual soil (GRS) and completely weathered granite (CWG) within WGS of varying weathering degrees. Initially, a one-dimensional compression test and a consolidated undrained triaxial test are employed to investigate and compare the mechanical characteristics. Subsequently, the microscopic evolution mechanisms from the fresh granite (FG) to WGS are analyzed through X-ray diffraction, fluorescence spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy tests. Finally, various relationships between the physical and mechanical parameters of WGS and their weathering characteristics are developed. The findings reveal that GRS exhibits a smaller compression index than CWG but possesses a larger compression modulus. CWG demonstrates a higher critical stress ratio and effective internal friction angle at the critical state, and the CWG's dynamic elastic modulus exceeds that of GRS. Upon normalization to yield E/Edmax, GRS confidence region resides below that of CWG. As weathering increases, the primary minerals in granite undergo weathering to produce secondary minerals, and the overall structural integrity declines. Furthermore, a strong correlation exists between the physical and mechanical parameters of WGS and its weathering indices. This study offers invaluable insights into the mechanical characteristics and microstructural mechanisms of WGS. Moreover, offering theoretical underpinning for future pertinent engineering construction endeavors. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {To study the propagation and attenuation characteristics of Rayleigh waves on the irregular seabed in saturated elastic half-space，a simplified dynamic model of irregular seabed sites is established with the fundamental equation of soil dynamics proposed by Zienkiewicz. By changing the boundary conditions，the Rayleigh equations are derived for the degradation model of uncovered seawater and overlying seawater when the water-soil contact interface is flat. And the dispersion and attenuation curves of Rayleigh waves under the influence of permeability coefficient，porosity，Poisson's ratio，and interface conditions are given. Based on the complex sea bed model，the effect of various factors on the dynamic response of seabed parameters，such as pore pressure and deformation during Rayleigh wave propagation，is analyzed. The results show that the soil mechanical parameters，such as elasticity modulus，permeability coefficient，and porosity，as well as the overlying water and the interface of sediment water，all affect the dynamic response of the seabed. The influence range and extent of different Rayleigh wave velocities on soil mechanical parameters differ along the soil depth. Elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio are important parameters that determine the properties of soil and are prerequisites for discussing the propagation characteristics of Rayleigh waves and the dynamic response of the soil. Their change affects the influence law of permeability coefficient，porosity，and other parameters. In the two simplified models，when the elastic modulus of the rock stratum is 6.017×1010 Pa and Poisson’s ratio is 0.38，the porosity and permeability coefficient have regular effects on the propagation characteristics of Rayleigh waves. © 2023 Hunan University.

However, few studies have focused on the impact of PSD on coral particles. In this study, two different soil families were prepared: one with three levels of mean particle size (D50) with identical uniformity coefficient (Cu)and the other with four levels of Cu with the same D50 for coral gravelly soils. In addition, a series of undrained cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on coral gravelly particles with two groups of PSDs at a relative density of 40% and an adequate confining pressure of 100 kPa. The test results indicated that D50 with identical Cu can affect the undrained cyclic behavior of coral gravelly particles. In contrast, Cu with identical D50 does not impact the undrained cyclic behavior of coral gravelly particles. The developing pore water pressure was uniform when the sample was subjected to the same cyclic loading. For samples with changing D50 values of 2.35, 4.70, and 7.05 mm, increasing D50 improved the cyclic liquefaction resistance. For samples with changing Cu, increasing Cu in the range of 1.06–5.00 first increased and then decreased the liquefaction resistance. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {By using the stress-controlled undrained dynamic triaxial cyclic shear tests, relationship between accumulative energy dissipation of tailing soil and pore water pressure is investigated based on the critical factors, namely, cyclic stress ratio and consolidation stress ratio. The test results indicate that, during the process of cyclic shear, the increase of pore water pressure is closely related to the accumulative energy dissipation of plastic strain and viscous properties. A critical state, when the cyclic stress ratio Ŗ varies within the range of 0.205~0.238 and the consolidation stress ratio Ķ varies in 1.0~1.3, occurs between the pore water pressure and energy. Therefore, through nonlinear regression analysis, the energy model for pore water pressure of saturated tailing soil is preliminarily established based on the cyclic stress ratio and the axial-radial consolidation stress ratio, and it can be adequately employed to demonstrate the variations of pore water pressure without considering the uncertainty of cyclic loading number which can otherwise hinder the establishment of the model. In addition, the proposed model may also be a valuable source of reference for predicting the development of pore water pressure of saturated soil under cyclic loading. © 2016, Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Geotechnical Engineering.

	abstract = {An eco-friendly way to improve the engineering properties of lower-strength soils becomes attractive. This study investigates the feasibility of two industrial by-products, i.e., coal gangue (CG) and calcium carbide residue (CCR), as a sustainable CG–CCR geopolymer binder for soil stabilization. The geomechanical properties, compressibility, and microstructure of marine clay stabilized using CG–CCR geopolymer with different content by mass from 0 to 30% are measured by conducting consolidated undrained (CU) triaxial compression tests, oedometer tests, X-ray diffraction, mercury intrusion porosimetry, and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. A new empirical model is proposed to predict the failure strength of stabilized soils. Results indicate that the CG–CCR geopolymer can enhance the geomechanical properties of marine clay. Increasing the geopolymer content to 15% transforms the behavior of stabilized soils from a strain-hardening response (ductile failure) into a strain-softening response (brittle failure). The failure strength increases with the geopolymer content, confining pressure, and curing time. Increasing the geopolymer content to 30% improves the cohesion and internal friction angle to 479.8 kPa and 21.1°, respectively, being approximately 96.1 and 4.9 times those of unstabilized soil. The geopolymer content of 30% is found as the optimum to achieve the lowest compressibility. Microstructural analyses show that the reaction products of CG–CCR geopolymer binder could fill the intergranular pores and densify the soil by reducing the void space between soil particles, explaining the strength improvement of marine clay. This study provides a potential strategy for enhancing the geomechanical properties of marine clay by utilizing industrial geological waste. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Adding rubber into sands has been found to improve the mechanical behavior of sands, including their dynamic properties. However, ambiguous and even contradictory results have been reported regarding the dynamic behavior of sand-rubber mixtures, particularly in terms of the damping ratio. A series of cyclic triaxial tests were, therefore, performed under a large range of shear strains on sand-rubber mixtures with varying rubber volume contents, rubber particle sizes, and confining pressures. The results indicate the dynamic shear modulus decreases with increasing rubber volume content and with decreasing particle size and confining pressure. The relationship of the damping ratio to the evaluated parameters is complicated and strain-dependent; at shear strains less than a critical value, the damping ratio increases with increasing rubber volume content, whereas the opposite trend is observed at greater shear strains. Furthermore, sand-rubber mixtures with different rubber particle sizes exceed the damping ratio of pure sand at different rubber volume contents. A new empirical model to predict the maximum shear moduli of mixtures with various rubber volume contents, rubber particle sizes, and confining pressures is accordingly proposed. This study provides a reference for the design of sand-rubber mixtures in engineering applications. © 2020 by the authors.},

In order to investigate the influences of the stiffness of backfill materials on the deformation of flexible joints in the immersed tunnels, the numerical tests of longitudinal dynamic response analysis under incidence of P waves are carried out for Ruyifang immersed tunnel in Guangzhou by using the particle-spring-beam model with implementation of the longitudinal displacement method and the flexible joint model with the longitudinal limit devices. The results show that the numerical model and method can make the structures respond in a timely and reasonable manner. When the longitudinal response displacement method is used for calculation and analysis, the time histories of multi-point displacement in the free field should be extracted as the excitation of the structures. The untreated soft silt clay cannot be used as the backfill materials. If the density of sand or gravel is increased, the seismic capacity will be further improved.

	abstract = {In order to study the relationship between the accumulative plastic strain growth and the energy dissipation, and to further classify the pattern of the accumulative plastic strain growth, dynamic consolidated-undrained triaxial shear tests are conducted on tailing silts with different void ratios under different cyclic stress ratios. The energy dissipation in soil is divided into plastic strain and viscous accumulative energy dissipations. According to the relationships, failure modes of the accumulative plastic strain growth are reclassified, and the development of accumulative plastic strain is interpreted based on the improved energy dissipation mechanism. The research highlights that as the cyclic stress ratio keeps increasing, the rate of dissipation of viscous accumulative energy will exceed that of the plastic strain accumulative energy,and the development mode of accumulative plastic strain will turn from the stability to the failure. Furthermore, the failure modes are reasonably divided into four categories: stable type, stable damage type, damage type and collapse. Essentially, the plastic strain accumulative energy will dissipate due to the rearrangement among relatively large particles such as sand and silt grains. Similarly, the viscous accumulative energy will dissipate because of the relative slippage among clay particles and colloid particles under the relaxation of weak bound water in the double electrical layers. This energy dissipation mechanism is consistent with the proposed failure pattern of the accumulative plastic strain growth. The research results may provide a basis for further model researches on the accumulative plastic strain growth. © 2017, Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Geotechnical Engineering.

Soil permeability is very sensitive and highly pertains to its microstructure. When subjected to the saline environment changes, the changes in soil permeability may increase leakage risk in the burial fillers and endanger the environment. Herein, to facilitate the understanding of the negative correlation between the permeability and ion concentrations in some low plastic limit clays, NaCl solution seepage circulation experiments considering different porosities, sample preparation methods, and ion concentration stages were conducted. Combined with the micro test methods (SEM and MIP) and the fractal theory, the changes in soil permeability at different ion concentrations and the mechanism were studied. The main results showed that compression methods are more suitable than the impact-involved methods for making uniform soil samples; the decrease of the soil’s pore fractal dimension evidenced that the growth of ion concentration would increase the dispersal of soil particles while the morphological change of the dispersal process resembles the blossom of a flower, i.e., the sprout→bud phase→blossom; the dispersed particles are prone to form flocculation in large-size pores (6–8 μm in this paper) and decrease the soil permeability. This dispersal and flocculation effect progressively triggered by the growth of ion concentration can provide new insight into understanding the negative correlation between the permeability and ion concentrations in some low plastic limit clays. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Although widely used in coastal construction, the reinforcement of calcareous sand is necessary due to its natures of low bearing capacity and high compressibility. Aiming for this, an environmentally bio-grouting technique, microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) was applied to reinforce the calcareous sand. However, MICP treatment is in turn influenced by the properties of calcareous sand, such as particle size and gradation. To reveal the effects of particle size and gradation, the MICP-treated calcareous sands with various median sizes, uniformity coefficients or curvature coefficients, were conducted with the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests and a series of laboratory experiments. The results indicated that with the median size or uniformity coefficient increasing, the UCS of the MICP-treated specimens decreased; while with increasing curvature coefficient, the UCS exhibited a trend of increasing before decreasing. Further experiments reveal that particle size and gradation affect the MICP process mainly by changing the amounts and volume of pores. The current study demonstrates the respective effects of particle size and gradation on the treatment of MICP and provides a theoretical reference for reinforcing calcareous sand in marine engineering. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

This study investigates energy evolution and damping characteristics through single cyclic loading–unloading uniaxial compression tests and acoustic emission (AE) monitoring on sandstone and granite, considering stress history. A strong linear relationship between cumulative AE energy and cumulative damage energy validates the theory of viscoelastic-plastic energy conversion in rocks. Additionally, the study discovered the linear energy damping (LED) law, characterized by a consistent linear relationship between damping energy and input energy, and a constant linear energy damping coefficient (LEDC) defined by linear fitting parameter A. Based on the LED law, two damping ratio calculation formulas (λLED,i=(A2ui+B2)/π(A1ui+B1), λI-LED=A2/πA1) were proposed.

	abstract = {Microbial-induced calcite precipitation (MICP) has been a promising method to improve geotechnical engineering properties through the precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3 ) on the contact and surface of soil particles in recent years. In the present experiment, water absorption and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests were carried out to investigate the effects of three different fiber types (glass fiber, polyester fiber, and hemp fiber) on the physical and mechanical properties of MICP-treated calcareous sand. The fibers used were at 0%, 0.10%, 0.15%, 0.20%, 0.25%, 0.30%, 0.35%, and 0.40% relative to the weight of the sand. The results showed that the failure strain and ductility of the samples could be improved by adding fibers. Compared to biocemented sand (BS), the water absorption of these three fiber-reinforced biocemented sands were, respectively, decreased by 11.60%, 21.18%, and 7.29%. UCS was, respectively, increased by 24.20%, 60.76%, and 6.40%. Polyester fiber produced the best effect, followed by glass fiber and hemp fiber. The optimum contents of glass fiber and polyester fiber were 0.20% and 0.25%, respectively. The optimum content of hemp fiber was within the range of 0.20–0.25%. Light-emitting diode (LED) microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images lead to the conclusion that only a little calcite precipitation had occurred around the hemp fiber, leading to a poor bonding effect compared to the glass and polyester fibers. It was therefore suggested that polyester fiber should be used to improve the properties of biocemented sand. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP)–fiber combined reinforcement through the addition of fibers during the MICP process is a novel, natural, and green technique for foundation improvement, which can effectively enhance the mechanical properties of cemented soil. However, the small-strain dynamic properties of this method remain unexplored. The effects of different polyester fiber and hemp fiber contents (0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.4%) on the dynamic properties of the MICP–fiber combined reinforced calcareous sand under small-strain conditions were studied using resonant column tests, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The maximum dynamic shear modulus of the MICP–fiber combined reinforced calcareous sand under small-strain increases with the fiber content; the stiffness degradation rate of the dynamic shear modulus ratio of the test sample increases with the addition of two types of fibers, and the addition of hemp fibers greatly boosts the increase rate of the damping ratio. The SEM results indicate that excessive fibers distributed between the sand particles occupy the nucleation sites of bacteria, hinder the bonding between sand particles, and ultimately affect the dynamic shear modulus parameters of the sample. The AFM results show that the hemp fiber has much greater surface roughness than the polyester fiber. Therefore, the change rate of the damping ratio of the hemp fiber-doped MICP–fiber combined reinforced calcareous sand is much greater than that of the polyester fiber-doped sample. This is the first report on the basic mechanism of the small-strain dynamic properties of the MICP–fiber combined reinforced calcareous sand with different fiber contents and types. Furthermore, it provides a new theoretical basis for related research on improving the dynamic properties of sand thus reinforced. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Microbial-induced calcite precipitation (MICP) is an environmentally friendly treatment method for soil improvement. When combined with carbon fiber (CF), MICP can enhance the liquefaction resistance of sand. In this study, the effects of CF content (relative to the sand weight of 0%, 0.2%, 0.3%, and 0.4%) on the liquefaction resistance of MICP-treated silica and calcareous sand were investigated. The analysis was conducted using bacterial retention test, cyclic triaxial (CTX) test, LCD optical microscope, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that with the increase in CF content, the bacterial retention rate increased. Additionally, the cumulative cycles of axial strain to 5%, excess pore water pressure to initial liquefaction, as well as strength and stiffness, all increased with higher CF content. This trend continued up to the CF content of 0.2% for silica sand and 0.3% for calcareous sand, beyond which the cumulative cycles began to decrease. The great mechanical system of CF, calcite, and sand particles was significantly strengthened after MICP-treated. However, the reinforced calcite did not completely cover the CF, and excess CF hindered the connection between sand grains. The optimal amount of CF in silica and calcareous sands were 0.2% and 0.3%. This study provides valuable guidance for selecting the optimal CF content in the future MICP soil engineering. © The Author(s) 2025.},

This study aimed to reveal the flow grouting mechanism of slurry in the reserved space between piles and soil and the penetration diffusion rule of slurry in the soil around the piles. For this purpose, the grouting slurry was regarded as a Newtonian fluid. The Navier–Stokes equations of fluid mechanics and renormalization group k–ε model were used to study the flow diffusion of slurry in the reserved space around a pile for grouting the drilling with prestressed concrete pipes. The permeability of soil slurry was determined using Darcy's law, and the flow field of slurry during grouting was numerically simulated. The results showed that the flow velocity of slurry and the reinforcement effect of grouting decrease gradually as the flow path extends. The radial flow of slurry in the grouting pipe shows a clear trend of circumferential diffusion. The slurry thickness in the reserved space for grouting decreases with an increase in the distance from the grouting outlet. Its attenuation trend becomes more obvious with increasing grouting height. The grouting thickness directly reflects the filling effect of slurry and is an important index to evaluate the grouting effect of drilling with prestressed concrete pipes. © 2023 International Federation for Structural Concrete.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the use of calcium carbide residue (CCR) as a potential alternative to NaOH for activating coal gangue (CG) geopolymers, both of industrial waste. A series of experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of CCR content, NaOH:Na2SiO3 mass ratios, liquid to solid ratio (L/(CG + CCR)), and curing time on the strength development of CG-CCR geopolymers. Moreover, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) were used to analyze the reaction products and microstructural characteristics of CG-CCR geopolymer. Accordingly, the CG-CCR geopolymers were applied to stabilize soft soil. Experimental results indicate that CCR could significantly enhance the compressive strength of CG-CCR geopolymer. A CCR content of 20% correlates to the greatest increase in 3-d compressive strength (327.6%) compared with pure CG geopolymer (CCR = 0%). The optimal NaOH:Na2SiO3 mass ratio is 50:50, while the compressive strength increases with decreasing L/(CG + CCR) and increasing curing time. Based on the analysis of microstructure (XRD, FTIR, TGA, MIP, and FESEM), it was inferred that CCR could promote the polymerization reaction and increase the reaction products (primarily N-A-S-H and C-A-S-H gels) of CG-CCR geopolymers, which are responsible for the strength development. Additionally, CG-CCR geopolymer has a positive impact on the stress–strain relationship and strength of stabilized soil. This study demonstrates that CCR can be used as a partial replacement for NaOH in generating CG geopolymer, which can provide an effective path for disposing of CG and CCR as well as lead to more practical applications for geopolymer in soil stabilization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Ice-rich permafrost in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), China, is becoming susceptible to thermokarst landforms, and the most dramatic among these terrain-altering landforms is retrogressive thaw slump (RTS). Concurrently, RTS development can in turn affect the eco-environment, and especially soil erosion and carbon emission, during their evolution. However, there are still a lack of quantitative methods and comprehensive studies on the deformation and volumetric change in RTS. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively assess the RTS evolution through a novel and feasible simulation framework of the GPU-based discrete element method (DEM) coupled with the finite difference method (FDM). Additionally, the simulation results were calibrated using the time series observation results from September 2021 to August 2022, using the combined methods of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The results reveal that, over this time, thaw slump mobilized a total volume of 1335 m3 and approximately 1050 m3 moved to a displaced area. Additionally, the estimated soil erosion was about 211 m3. Meanwhile, the corresponding maximum ground subsidence and headwall retrogression were 1.9 m and 3.2 m, respectively. We also found that the amount of mass wasting in RTS development is highly related to the ground ice content. When the volumetric ice content exceeds 10%, there will be obvious mass wasting in the thaw slump development area. Furthermore, this work proposed that the coupled DEM-FDM method and field survey method of TLS-UAV can provide an effective pathway to simulate thaw-induced slope failure problems and complement the research limitations of small-scale RTSs using remote sensing methods. The results are meaningful for assessing the eco-environmental impacts on the QTP. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Flexible joints represent the most vulnerable aspect of the immersed tunnel, necessitating effective waterproofing and the transmission of forces between tunnel segments. However, the role of longitudinal limit devices in the seismic behavior of immersed tunnels is frequently overlooked in contemporary research on their seismic robustness. This study develops a longitudinal force model for flexible joints that incorporates the longitudinal limit device, building upon the beam-spring model of the immersed tunnel. Concurrently, a scaled partial experiment on the immersed tunnel's flexible joint is undertaken, and validated and compared to the theoretical model. Subsequently, this model is utilized in the seismic assessment of the Ruyifang immersed tunnel. The computational findings revealed a considerable improvement in the seismic resilience of the immersed tunnel following the integration of longitudinal limit devices. With the incorporation of these devices, the opening of flexible joints diminished by 20% to 50% compared to scenarios lacking such devices. In addition, the peak acceleration of the tunnel segments’ mid-point structural response decreased by approximately 50%, accompanied by a significant reduction in the internal force response within the tunnel segments. As proposed in this research, the longitudinal force model for flexible joints under longitudinal limit devices represents the behavior of immersed tunnels under seismic stress more accurately. These numerical simulation outcomes also offer valuable insights for designing flexible joints in immersed tunnels. © 2024 Tongji University.},

This study proposed an eco-friendly method of stabilizing marine soil using a calcium carbide residue (CCR)-activated coal gangue (CG) geopolymer derived from industrial waste. Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the mechanical properties, durability performance, and stabilization mechanisms of stabilized marine soils under multiple wetting-dry cycles. The results highlighted the effectiveness of CG-CCR geopolymer by a content of 15% to achieve satisfactory strength gain over the engineering requirements. However, the largest decrease in strength (71.89%) was observed when the initial water content was beyond 1.5 times the liquid limit (LL). The optimum solution was proposed to have a geopolymer content of 15% or an initial water content of 1.25·LL to exhibit the highest resistance to strength decay after 12 cycles. Compared with water intrusion, mass loss had a more significant effect on soil strength deterioration. The formation of noncrystalline or amorphous-phase reaction products effectively filled intergranular pores and reduced the void space between soil particles, improving the mechanical properties.

	abstract = {The Rayleigh wave propagation in the irregular bottom of the ocean, which is the interface of a homogeneous non-viscous liquid layer overlaying a porous half-space, under the influence of different factors has been discussed. The mathematical model is established by formula derivation. The propagation and attenuation characteristics of Rayleigh waves in a liquid layer over a transverse isotropy liquid-saturated porous half-space with irregular interface were studied. In addition, the dispersion and attenuation equations of the phase velocity and the attenuation coefficient with respect to the wave number were derived by which the effects of different parameters were analyzed. It was found that the magnitude of phase velocity varies with respect to the corrugation degree of the interface. In addition, irrespective of the type of interface, initially the attenuation coefficient rapidly increases and after the maximum value, it becomes constant. Furthermore, it has been observed that the change of the permeability coefficient affects the Rayleigh wave attenuation for the low wave number. For the low wave number, smaller permeability coefficient results in larger phase velocity and smaller attenuation. Moreover, both the phase velocity and the attenuation coefficient will eventually approach constant value in the high wave number region, for all parameters. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Different gas hydrate types, such as methane hydrate and carbon dioxide hydrate, exhibit distinct geomechanical responses and hydrate morphologies in gas-hydrate-bearing sediments (GHBSs). However, most constitutive models for GHBSs focus on methane-hydrate-bearing sediments (MHBSs), while largely overlooking carbon-dioxide-hydrate-bearing sediments (CHBSs). This paper proposes a modified Mohr–Coulomb (M-C) model for GHBSs that incorporates the geomechanical effects of both MHBSs and CHBSs. The model integrates diverse hydrate morphologies—cementing, load-bearing, and pore-filling—into hydrate saturation and incorporates an effective confining pressure. Its validity was demonstrated through simulations of reported triaxial compression tests for both MHBSs and CHBSs. Moreover, a variance-based sensitivity analysis using Sobol’s method evaluated the effects of hydrate-related soil properties on the geomechanical behavior of GHBSs. The results indicate that the shear modulus influences the yield axial strain of the CHBSs and could be up to 1.15 times more than that of the MHBSs. Similarly, the bulk modulus showed an approximate 5% increase in its impact on the yield volumetric strain of the CHBSs compared with the MHBSs. These findings provide a unified framework for modeling GHBSs and have implications for CO2-injection-induced methane production from deep sediments, advancing the understanding and simulation of GHBS geomechanical behavior. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study the asymmetric collapse mechanism of the overlying rock mass of shallow tunnel under seismic load. Based on the Hoek-Brown failure criterion, combined with the upper bound theorem of the limit analysis and the variational method of the variable endpoints problem, the analytical solution of the asymmetric collapse curve is proposed. The effects of seismic body wave and rock parameters on the asymmetric collapse curve are analyzed. It can be found that, without considering the damage of rock mass, the S-wave will tilt the geometric shape of collapsing block, which is beneficial to restrain the collapse. And the restrain effect is more significant in the rock mass with better mechanical properties. The backward propagation of P-wave will promote the collapse of the rock block and make the geometrical area of the collapsing block smaller. This implies that under seismic load, a smaller range of allowable velocity field can lead to the ultimate failure state of rock mass. The conclusion of this paper will help to provide a safer design and construction guidance for engineering practice. © 2022, Science Press. All right reserved.},

	abstract = {Calcareous gravelly sand (CGS) is the primary building material used in the foundation filling of island-reefs in the South China Sea. In this study, multiple consolidation-drained triaxial shear tests were conducted on CGS, in order to reveal the effects of relative density (Dr) and effective confining pressure (σ3′) on the CGS dilatancy. The applicability of classical dilatancy equations to CGS was tested. An empirical dilatancy equation applicable to calcareous sand was proposed and the rationality of this dilatancy equation was validated. According to the results: (I) Phase-transition stress ratio (ηp) and failure dilatancy ratio (df) are important indices for assessing the CGS dilatancy. Physical models were built to predict the ηp and df of CGS based on its Dr and σ3′, respectively. (II) The dilatancy equation of the modified Cam-clay model could not reflect the CGS dilatancy. Rowe's dilatancy equation could reflect the CGS dilatancy to some extent, but it underestimated the CGS dilatancy when σ3' ≤ 50 kPa and overestimated the CGS dilatancy when σ3' ≥ 400 kPa. (III) A good linear relationship was identified between dilatancy ratio and stress ratio-related parameter (ηf2-η2η0.5). Therefore, the empirical dilatancy equation built on this basis is highly applicable to calcareous sand. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) is an important hydraulic property that describes the relationship between matric suction and water content in unsaturated soils. However, existing SWCC models for gap-graded soil are highly empirical and fail to account for the influence of soil physical properties on SWCC. SWCC models for continuous-graded soil don't consider the packing between particles, which results in predictions that are inconsistent with measured data. To solve the above limitation, this study proposed a new pore capillary model considering the packing of coarse and fine-grained soils and established a unimodal SWCC model called GU (Gap-graded soil and Unimodal SWCC) for gap-graded soil based on bimodal grain-size distribution (GSD) and fractal theory. There were only two physical fitting parameters in the GU model, pore fractal dimension and maximum adsorbed water content. The new proposed GU model was verified by published measured data and compared with SAP model, a representative SWCC theoretical model for continuous-graded soil. The verification and comparison prove that SWCCs predicted by the GU model have fewer error and a more reasonable variation trend than SWCCs predicted by the SAP model for different types of gap-graded soils. Thus, this study provides a novel approach to establish the relationship between soil properties and SWCC for gap-graded soil based on soil water retention mechanisms, which is important for subsequent studies of hydraulic properties. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Currently, the mechanical properties of calcareous sand are mainly studied through triaxial tests, as traditional uniaxial compression tests fail to capture real loading conditions and soil strength anisotropy. To address this, true triaxial tests were conducted to examine the effect of the intermediate principal stress parameter (b) on the three-dimensional strength and deformation behavior of calcareous sand. In the constant b and σ3 tests, as the b value increased, both the strength and peak friction angle (φps) of calcareous sand were increased, while the tangent slope of the dilatancy curve showed a gradual rise. The φps of calcareous sand was found to be higher compared to silica sand and coarse-grained soils. In the constant mean effective stress (p) and b test, the strength was increased with higher values of both b and p. The Matsuoka-Nakai 3D strength criterion proved more effective in fitting the 3D strength of calcareous sand in π plane. As the b value increased, the critical stress ratio (Mc) was decreased. A quadratic function can better represent the Mc of calcareous sand in the π plane under varying confining pressures. Furthermore, the Mc of calcareous sand was higher than that of silica sand and completely decomposed granite soil. This study provides a valuable experimental basis for understanding the 3D strength and deformation characteristics of calcareous sand in oceanic engineering infrastructure. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {The strength of marine clay under cyclic loading is affected by its mineral composition, which must be considered in engineering design. Consolidated undrained cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on specimens from two groups of samples of artificial marine clays consisting of four pure minerals (quartz, albite, Na-montmorillonite and kaolinite) in mass proportion (Qc:Ac:Mc:Kc). The study of two test groups was to identify differences in the properties of the soils due to montmorillonite and kaolinite (MKDT group) and the differences due to the nonclay minerals (NCDT group). The results demonstrated the following main points. The power function curves for cyclic strength derived from conventional strain failure criteria show that both montmorillonite and clay minerals significantly increase cyclic strength. Furthermore, the energy based viscous energy dissipation ratio (VEDR) was introduced to partition cyclic loading process into two stages: competition and rapid increasing. There were two critical points in the cyclic loading procedure, VEDRmin and VEDRbreakpoint, that represent initial energy dissipation and turning-point energy dissipation. Therefore, by connecting the VEDRbreakpoint points, the linear VEDR cyclic strength curve (NVEDR-VEDRbreakpoint) was created with two parameters, slopVEDR and VEDRintercept. By analogy with the parameters of conventional cyclic strength curve (a, b and CSRmin), slopVEDR and VEDRintercept respectively reflect that influence of cyclic loading and mineral composition on VEDRbreakpoint. Additionally, it is also demonstrated that both montmorillonite and clay minerals reinforce VEDR cyclic strength just like the conventional one. This research makes a major contribution to our understanding of cyclic strength by accounting for energy dissipation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The selection of appropriate inter-particle parameters in discrete element method (DEM) simulations is crucial, and the commonly used trial-and-error method has been criticised for its uncontrollability and high computational cost. Therefore, this study proposes a new framework based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) as an alternative method for calibrating inter-particle parameters in calcareous sand materials. Firstly, a biaxial test dataset for calcareous sand was generated using DEM simulations. This data set was then used to train a CNN to capture the primary underlying correlation between macroscopic mechanical properties and the inter-particle parameters of the contact model. To demonstrate the powerful performance of CNN, this paper also established a back-propagation neural network (BP) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) as control experiments. The results showed that the CNN had higher prediction accuracy compared to the BP and GRU models. After DEM simulation using the parameters predicted by the CNN, it was found that the stress–strain curves and failure patterns closely matched the results of the laboratory tests. This confirms that the CNN can quickly and accurately determine the inter-particle parameters for DEM simulation and verifies the robustness of the CNN model in predicting laboratory test results, this method provides a reference for the calibration of DEM parameters for calcareous sand, thereby offering strong support for the use of calcareous sand in marine development and construction projects. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.},

However, few tests have been conducted for the dynamic characteristics of fine-grained soil, especially for high plasticity clay (CH), which is often composed of fine particles and even colloidal particles (less than 0.002 mm), including primary soil minerals and secondary clay minerals. According to the results of X-ray diffraction tests on the mineral composition of marine clay in the Pearl River Delta and Han River Delta in Guang-dong Province, resonant column tests were performed with mixture samples of four mineral components in which quartz and albite act as matrix and Na-montmorillonite and kaolinite act as variable quantity, with particle size less than 0.074mm, and are reported in this paper. The growth of Na-montmorillonite content is demonstrated as increasing the maximum dynamic shear modulus. Combined with sample performance under an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM), the fact that maximum dynamic shear modulus is determined by the initial state of particle compositions is clarified. Given the same void ratio and stress history condition, the sample with higher Na-montmorillonite content, due to the property of Na-montmorillonite minerals, forms a flocculation structure with more intergranular contact and is conductive to shear-wave propagation. The results further show that plasticity is influenced by mineral compositions as an internal reason and reflects the maximum dynamic shear modulus. © 2019 Associazione Geotecnica Italiana, Rome, Italy.},
