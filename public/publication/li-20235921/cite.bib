 abstract = {An eco-friendly way to improve the engineering properties of lower-strength soils becomes attractive. This study investigates the feasibility of two industrial by-products, i.e., coal gangue (CG) and calcium carbide residue (CCR), as a sustainable CG–CCR geopolymer binder for soil stabilization. The geomechanical properties, compressibility, and microstructure of marine clay stabilized using CG–CCR geopolymer with different content by mass from 0 to 30% are measured by conducting consolidated undrained (CU) triaxial compression tests, oedometer tests, X-ray diffraction, mercury intrusion porosimetry, and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. A new empirical model is proposed to predict the failure strength of stabilized soils. Results indicate that the CG–CCR geopolymer can enhance the geomechanical properties of marine clay. Increasing the geopolymer content to 15% transforms the behavior of stabilized soils from a strain-hardening response (ductile failure) into a strain-softening response (brittle failure). The failure strength increases with the geopolymer content, confining pressure, and curing time. Increasing the geopolymer content to 30% improves the cohesion and internal friction angle to 479.8 kPa and 21.1°, respectively, being approximately 96.1 and 4.9 times those of unstabilized soil. The geopolymer content of 30% is found as the optimum to achieve the lowest compressibility. Microstructural analyses show that the reaction products of CG–CCR geopolymer binder could fill the intergranular pores and densify the soil by reducing the void space between soil particles, explaining the strength improvement of marine clay. This study provides a potential strategy for enhancing the geomechanical properties of marine clay by utilizing industrial geological waste. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},
