 abstract = {The new damping ratio can accurately estimate the value of damping ratio at peak strength. The linear energy damping law enables the calculation of damping strain energy density at peak strength. The linear relationship between AE energy and strain energy is used to prove the energy conversion theory of viscoelastic plastic rocks. Stress history significantly affects the linear energy storage law fitting parameter B and the |B/A|. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2025.; The damping ratio of rocks is essential for evaluating rock mass stability under dynamic loads. This study investigates energy evolution and damping characteristics through single cyclic loading–unloading uniaxial compression tests and acoustic emission (AE) monitoring on sandstone and granite, considering stress history. A strong linear relationship between cumulative AE energy and cumulative damage energy validates the theory of viscoelastic-plastic energy conversion in rocks. Additionally, the study discovered the linear energy damping (LED) law, characterized by a consistent linear relationship between damping energy and input energy, and a constant linear energy damping coefficient (LEDC) defined by linear fitting parameter A. Based on the LED law, two damping ratio calculation formulas (λLED,i=(A2ui+B2)/π(A1ui+B1), λI-LED=A2/πA1) were proposed. The results showed that the LED law enables the calculation of damping strain energy density at peak strength. The LEDC serves as an effective parameter for characterizing the damping capacity of various rock types λLED,i represents the evolution curve of the damping ratio, while λI-LED provides accurate estimates of the damping ratio at peak strength compared to traditional methods and reflects reliable stability. Stress history significantly affects the linear energy storage law fitting parameter B and the |B/A|. The research findings offer a novel method for calculating the energy relationship and damping ratio under ultimate stress states, enhancing the reliability of geotechnical engineering designs, and reducing disaster risks. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2025.},
