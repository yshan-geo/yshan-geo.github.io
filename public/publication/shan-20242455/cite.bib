 abstract = {The microbially induced calcite precipitation(MICP) is a reinforcement technique aiming at reducing carbon emissions and pollution，and it can effectively enhance the dynamic properties of sandy soils. The MICP is applied to strengthen calcareous sand samples in the South China Sea region. A series of resonant column tests and scanning electron microscope tests are conducted to thoroughly investigate the impact of particle size(d50)，uniformity coefficient(Cu)，and curvature coefficient(Cc) on the maximum dynamic shear modulus(Gmax) of MICP-treated sandy soils. The experiment results indicate that the Gmax of untreated sand increases with increasing d50，decreases with increasing Cu，and initially decreases and then increases with increasing Cc. Meanwhile，the Gmax of the MICP-treated sand maintains the same relationship with Cu and Cc of the untreated sand，but it increases initially and then decreases with increasing d50. Furthermore，the MICP cementing effect correlates with the calcium carbonate content ， with differences in calcium carbonate content attributed to variations in particle size and uniformity of particle gradation，which mainly influence bacterial retention through differences in pore number and volume. Separate Gmax prediction models considering particle size and gradation characteristics are proposed，with a large amount of literature data used to verify the validity and applicability of the proposed models，depending on whether the initial pore ratio corrected for calcium carbonate content is taken into account. The experimental study provides a theoretical basis for the practical engineering application of MICP to improve the dynamic properties in calcareous sands. © 2024 Academia Sinica.
