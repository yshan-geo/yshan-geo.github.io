 abstract = {Marine clays are easily affected by different mineral composition in cyclic load-based geological hazards. Therefore, based on analyzing the mineral composition of natural marine clay, it is the key to predict the dynamic properties of natural materials under cyclic loading by using quantitated artificial marine clay. In this study, the marine clay found in the South China Sea deltas was investigated. Based on the results of geological conditions and mineral composition analyses, raw non-clay minerals (such as quartz, albite) and clay minerals (such as Na-montmorillonite and kaolinite) were used to produce artificial marine clay, the dynamic properties of which were studied from the impact of mineral composition. Dynamic triaxial laboratory testing for artificial marine clay comprising various clay minerals was performed under identical test conditions. The artificial marine clay with high montmorillonite content exhibited slower development of strain, more sluggish growth in pore water pressure, more rounded hysteresis curves, greater stiffness, and more prolonged viscous energy growth than the clay with low montmorillonite content. In addition, the flocculated fabric of the artificial marine clay with high montmorillonite content demonstrated sufficient pore space changes, more uniform pore distribution, and larger specific surface area than the dispersed fabric of the clay with low montmorillonite content. The factors arising from the influence of montmorillonite may lead to microstructural and fabric changes, hinder the development of pore water, and increase intergranular contact stiffness as well as delay the cyclic strain amplitude at the breakpoint of viscous energy dissipation. In general, the results presented in this study confirm that clay minerals, especially montmorillonite, have significant influence on the dynamic properties of large strain. Â© 2021 by the authors.
