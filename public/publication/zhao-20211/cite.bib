 abstract = {Microbial-induced calcite precipitation (MICP) has been a promising method to improve geotechnical engineering properties through the precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3 ) on the contact and surface of soil particles in recent years. In the present experiment, water absorption and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests were carried out to investigate the effects of three different fiber types (glass fiber, polyester fiber, and hemp fiber) on the physical and mechanical properties of MICP-treated calcareous sand. The fibers used were at 0%, 0.10%, 0.15%, 0.20%, 0.25%, 0.30%, 0.35%, and 0.40% relative to the weight of the sand. The results showed that the failure strain and ductility of the samples could be improved by adding fibers. Compared to biocemented sand (BS), the water absorption of these three fiber-reinforced biocemented sands were, respectively, decreased by 11.60%, 21.18%, and 7.29%. UCS was, respectively, increased by 24.20%, 60.76%, and 6.40%. Polyester fiber produced the best effect, followed by glass fiber and hemp fiber. The optimum contents of glass fiber and polyester fiber were 0.20% and 0.25%, respectively. The optimum content of hemp fiber was within the range of 0.20–0.25%. Light-emitting diode (LED) microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images lead to the conclusion that only a little calcite precipitation had occurred around the hemp fiber, leading to a poor bonding effect compared to the glass and polyester fibers. It was therefore suggested that polyester fiber should be used to improve the properties of biocemented sand. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},
