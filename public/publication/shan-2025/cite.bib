 abstract = {Evaluating cyclic liquefaction of soil from the perspective of energy dissipation provides a more comprehensive insight into its liquefaction mechanism. This study conducted a series of undrained cyclic triaxial tests using discrete element method to investigate the influence of plastic fines content (FC) on the dynamic characteristics of sand-clay mixtures. A new evaluation index, the Viscous Energy Dissipation Ratio (VEDR), is introduced to assess the energy dissipation performance of sand-clay mixtures. Macroscopically, it is shown that when FC < 30 %, increasing the fines content promotes the development of strain and pore water pressure, leading to a decrease in dynamic strength. However, when FC > 30 %, the trend reverses. In terms of energy dissipation, as the fines content increases, VEDR gradually transitions from the sand-like to the clay-like mode, exhibiting a unique transitional mode when FC = 50 %. Microscopically, the development of bond breakage is highly similar to that of VEDR. The bond breakage facilitates particle sliding and rolling, which is the fundamental factor causing the differences of energy dissipation between pure sand and sand-clay mixtures. This paper contributes to the mechanistic study of liquefaction criteria based on energy theory by establishing the connection between microscopic particle behavior and macroscopic energy dissipation during the cyclic liquefaction process.
